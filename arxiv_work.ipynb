      "text/plain": "'I. INTRODUCTION\\n\\nSmart grids (SGs) are improved versions of traditional\\npower grids and rely on two-way communication technology\\nto improve efficiency, reliability, and sustainability. Unlike\\nthe outdated and inefficient traditional power grids, which\\nsuffers from frequent power outages, SGs uses a variety of\\ntechnologies, such as sensors, analytic, and control systems,\\nto more effectively monitor and manage energy consumption,\\ngeneration, and distribution [1]. SG can monitor energy de-\\nmand and supply in real-time, making them more adaptable\\nto changing energy needs.\\n\\nSG provides greater transparency and accessibility to energy\\nproviders, allowing them to effectively monitor and manage\\ntheir energy consumption in real-time [2]. They also allow\\nutility companies to communicate with customers more effi-\\nciently, providing real-time feedback on energy consumption\\nand assisting customers in making informed decisions about\\n\\nenergy usage [3]. These features are due to a high-level\\ninterdependence between the power grid level and the net-\\nworking level of SG architectures [4]–[6]. However, high-level\\nof interdependency is also demonstrated during cyberattack\\nscenarios as an attack in the networking layer can alter the\\nbehavior in the power grid layer as well [4]. Thus, network\\nsecurity is a critical component of SG and they become more\\nvulnerable to cyberattacks as they become more interconnected\\nand reliant on communication networks [7], [8].\\n\\nCyberattacks could have severe consequences, ranging from\\npower outages for customers and millions of dollars of\\ndamages for providers [9]. In addition, SG need continuous\\nmonitoring and control and necessitates a network that can\\nhandle large amounts of data quickly and reliably, while\\nalso ensuring that data is delivered to the correct location\\nthe\\nand on time [10]. As the SG infrastructure expands,\\nnetwork’s complexity grows, necessitating more sophisticated\\nmanagement tools and expertise to ensure optimal network\\nperformance and security [11]. The network must be able to\\nhandle varying energy demand and supply, which can change\\nquickly and necessitate real-time network adjustments, and\\nongoing management\\nto ensure the safe, dependable, and\\nefficient delivery of energy to consumers. To address these\\nissues of security, flexibility, and network management, current\\nresearch efforts are investigating the application of software-\\ndefined networking (SDN) to improve network security and\\nperformance in SG [1], [12].\\n\\nSoftware-Defined Networking (SDN) is a network design\\ntechnique that allows networks to be intelligently and cen-\\ntrally controlled, or programmed, through the use of software\\napplications. SDN separates the control and data planes while\\nintegrating the control plane into the controller. This allows\\nfor greater flexibility and scalability in network infrastruc-\\nture management [13]. Software-defined networking (SDN)\\nresearch has shown rapid improvements and discoveries since\\nits public launch in 2009. Compared to traditional networks,\\nSDN has better utilization, efficiency of resources, flexibility\\nof network services, and reduced cost of maintenance [14].\\nManaging the complex infrastructure of a SG can be a\\ndaunting task with traditional networking, requiring significant\\nmanual intervention and human resources [1]. As shown in\\nFigure 1, SDN simplifies this process by providing a central-\\nized software controller that manages and configures network\\ndevices and protocols, automating many of the tasks involved\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cFig. 1. SD-SG Architecture\\n\\nin network management. The adoption of SDN with SG\\nhave created software defined SG (SD-SG) which experience\\nimproved network security, visibility and control by enabling\\nreal-time monitoring and analytics, allowing for proactive\\nidentification and resolution of network issues [15]. This level\\nof visibility and control is critical in managing the dynamic\\nand complex infrastructure of a SG, where energy source\\navailability can change rapidly.\\n\\nAlthough SDN can provide security response solutions, SD-\\nSG are susceptible to cyberattacks such as distributed denial\\nof service (DDoS), unauthorized access, false data injection,\\n\\netc [4]. Furthermore, the introduction of SDN introduces the\\nSD-SG to additional attacks that target specific elements of\\nthe SDN network such as the controller. Current research is\\ndisjointed and focuses on development of security frameworks\\nthat protect these SD-SG from these attacks by leveraging the\\nfeatures of SDN. There is a need for a review that centralizes,\\nsummarizes, and analyzes these approaches for the develop-\\nment of future efforts. Other literature [1], [16]–[20] have\\nsurveyed SD-SG and only briefly touches on network security\\nor are now outdated and do not contain recent techniques\\nand attack types in literature as this survey as summarized\\n\\n2\\n\\nData StoragePrivate ConsumersCommercial ConsumersPower Lines/TransmissionNon-RenewableEnergyRenewable EnergyCommunication Stream Energy StreamSDN ControllerADMS, SCADA, DERMS, and DMSSDN and Grid Control ApplicationsData/Infrastructure PlaneControl PlaneApplicationPlaneSouthbound APIsNorthbound APIs•Security Response/Management•Topology Management•Smart Grid Monitoring and Control•RoutingAssessment/Assignment•Real-Time Monitoring•StatisticalAnalysis•TrafficEngineering•Security Monitoring\\x0cin Table I. As a result, we present this survey to fill this void\\nby providing a comprehensive, up-to-date survey of current\\nthreats to SD-SG network security as well as novel future\\ndirections and open challenges for SD-SG network security\\nresearch. Therefore, the contributions of this survey are as\\nfollows:\\n\\n• An updated survey of cyberattacks affecting SD-SG and\\ncurrent SD-SG mitigation techniques, with a focus on\\nnovel research efforts in the last 5 years\\n\\n• A review of open, unresolved cyberattacks that are not\\naddressed in the current literature for SD-SG network\\nsecurity and discussion of emerging threats\\n\\n• A review of potential mitigation techniques for the emerg-\\n\\ning cyberattacks for SD-SG network security\\n\\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II\\ndescribes related work and compares them to this survey.\\nSection III provides background information of SDN and SD-\\nSG. Section III-A defines software defined SGs and provides a\\ndescriptive definition and review. The literature review of SD-\\nSG network security threats and their defense mechanisms are\\ndiscussed in section IV. The unsolved challenges for SD-SG\\nsecurity and emerging cyber threats are discussed in section V.\\nLastly, the paper is concluded in section VI.\\n\\nII. RELATED WORKS\\n\\nThis survey is novel from other surveys because it is the\\nfirst of its kind to provide an in-depth examination of network\\nsecurity threats and defense methods for SD-SG. Related lit-\\nerature have only briefly or completed forgone covering these\\ntopics in depth. Table I and summarizes the comparison of this\\nwork with other related literature and surveys. Table II presents\\na list of acronyms and their definitions used throughout the\\npaper. Table III summarizes related literature for both SG and\\nSD-SG security. This paper concentrates primarily on SD-\\nSG network security and persistent threats, therefore related\\nwork that focuses on SG security in general, as seen in the\\ntable, is outside its scope. Furthermore, in this paper, we\\nfocus mainly on related literature published within the last five\\nyears of the paper’s publication date to ensure that we survey\\nthe most recent, novel literature and solutions. This section\\nprovides a review of related literature and surveys of SD-SG\\nand highlights their missing components which are found in\\nthis survey.\\n\\nRehmani et al. [1] present a comprehensive literature re-\\nview of SDN in SG communications. The authors discuss\\nthe challenges posed by SGs and how SDNs can assist in\\novercoming them. This paper examines the benefits of SDN-\\nbased communication for SGs, including enhanced network\\nperformance, resource management, and security. The authors\\nprovide a comprehensive analysis of existing SG communi-\\ncation solutions based on SDN, including their architectures,\\nprotocols, applications, and security. Additionally, the paper\\nidentifies unresolved research issues and challenges that must\\nbe addressed to facilitate more efficient use of SDN-based\\ncommunication in SGs. It provides insights into technologies\\n\\nand identifies areas for future research and development. How-\\never, the paper’s security section mentioned within the paper\\nonly provides a brief overview of the security of SD-SG, and\\nthe security papers covered are now outdated. Furthermore,\\nit does not provide an in-depth discussion of future research\\nefforts for SD-SG security threats as mentioned in this paper.\\nIbdah et al. [16] discuss the vulnerabilities of using SDN\\nin SG systems. The authors start by outlining the architecture\\nof SDN-based SG systems as well as the security risks asso-\\nciated with this technology. The paper then proposes a five-\\ncomponent security framework for SDN-based SG systems:\\nsecure communication, secure data storage, secure compu-\\ntation, secure authentication, and secure access control. The\\nauthors go into detail about each of these components and how\\nthey can be used in an SDN-based SG system. The authors use\\nthe Mininet network emulator to simulate the effectiveness of\\ntheir proposed security framework. The simulation shows that\\nthe proposed framework is effective at mitigating various types\\nof security attacks, such as DoS attacks, data tampering, and\\nunauthorized access. Although the authors provide discussion\\nof security of SD-SG systems, the discussion is very brief and\\nfocuses on DDoS attacks and proposal of their framework. The\\nresearchers do not provide a comprehensive review of SD-SG\\nsecurity like this survey.\\n\\nAkkaya et al. [17] investigated the use of software-defined\\nnetworking (SDN) in wireless local networks (WLANs) for\\nSG applications. The authors begin by outlining the difficulties\\nthat traditional WLANs face when supporting SG applications,\\nsuch as scalability, reliability, and security. The paper proposes\\nan SDN-based architecture for WLANs in SG applications,\\nwhich includes a centralized control plane capable of dy-\\nnamically reconfiguring the network to meet changing needs.\\nThe authors detail the proposed architecture, including the\\nvarious components and their functions and use the NS-3\\nnetwork simulator [102] to simulate the effectiveness of the\\nproposed SDN-based architecture. The simulations show that\\nthe proposed architecture outperforms traditional WLANs in\\nterms of network performance, resource utilization, and secu-\\nrity. The researchers investigate the relevant security aspects\\nfor each deployment scenario as they progress. However,\\nthe researchers only provide discussion of anomaly/intrusion\\nattack detection and only provide breif discussion of controller\\nattacks. The paper does not provide discussion of DDoS\\nattacks nor defense techniques for the attacks mention in this\\npaper.\\n\\nAbujubbeh et al. [18] discusses the application of software-\\ndefined wireless sensor networks (SDWSNs) in SGs. The\\nauthors begin by discussing the advantages of SDWSNs\\nover traditional wireless sensor networks, such as increased\\nflexibility, scalability, and adaptability. The paper proposes\\na SDN architecture for SDWSNs in SGs to provide a cen-\\ntralized control plane for network management. The authors\\ndescribe the proposed architecture’s various components, such\\nas sensor nodes, SDN controllers, and network infrastructure.\\nIn addition, the paper discusses the various challenges that\\nSDWSNs face in SGs, such as security, energy efficiency,\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\x0cTABLE I\\nCOMPARISON OF RELATED LITERATURE ON SD-SG NETWORK SECURITY:\\n✓DESIGNATES THE TOPIC IS COVERED, ∗ DESIGNATES THE TOPIC IS PARTIALLY COVERED, AND\\n— DESIGNATE THE TOPIC IS NOT COVERED\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n[1]\\n[16]\\n[17]\\n[18]\\n[19]\\n[20]\\nThis Survey\\n\\nPublication\\nYear\\n2019\\n2017\\n2015\\n2019\\n2018\\n2015\\n2023\\n\\nDDoS\\nAttacks\\n—\\n∗\\n—\\n∗\\n✓\\n—\\n✓\\n\\nController\\nAttacks\\n∗\\n—\\n∗\\n—\\n—\\n—-\\n✓\\n\\nIntrusion\\nAttacks\\n∗\\n—\\n✓\\n—\\n∗\\n∗\\n✓\\n\\nDefense Techniques\\nfor each Cyberattack\\n∗\\n—\\n∗\\n∗\\n∗\\n∗\\n✓\\n\\nMultiple\\nAttacks\\n—\\n—\\n—\\n—\\n—\\n—\\n✓\\n\\nEmerging\\nThreats\\n—\\n—\\n—\\n—\\n—\\n—\\n✓\\n\\nand network reliability.

BACKGROUND\\n\\nA. What are software-defined smart grids?\\n\\nAs aforementioned, SD-SG are a form of SG that uti-\\nlizes SDN technology to better manage bus communications,\\nnetwork topology organization, security, and grid network\\nvisibility and control. Furthermore, SD-SG utilizes advanced\\ndata analytic with SDN and real-time monitoring to control\\nthe grid’s communication layer. An high-level overview of this\\nintegration and SDN within a SG can be seen in Figure 1. Each\\nlayer as it pertains to SD-SG can be defined as follows:\\n\\n• Infrastructure/Data Layer: This layer is predominantly\\nconcerned with the flow of data from and to SG entities\\nsuch as energy sources, servers, power transmission lines,\\nand private/commercial consumers. This data is transmit-\\nted to programmable SDN-based switches and routers for\\nrouting to the intended location. Control layer routing\\ninformation is implemented in this layer.\\n\\n• Control Layer: This SD-SG layer is primarily com-\\nposed of two components: the SDN controller(s) and\\nthe advanced distribution management system. (ADMS).\\nADMS consists of supplementary control and data acqui-\\nsition (SCADA), distributed energy resource management\\n(DERMS), and distribution management system (DMS)\\nin order to monitor the smart grid system. This layer\\nreceives and transmits data to the application layer.\\n\\n• Application Layer: This is the highest\\n\\nlayer and it\\npredominantly receives input in the form of data from\\nthe lower two layers in order to ensure that the system\\nis operating in accordance with the established policies.\\nTo ensure the safety and stability of the SD-SG,\\nit\\nexecutes real-time monitoring, statistical analysis, traffic\\nengineering, and security monitoring.\\n\\nMore detailed informaiton of the SDN layers and inter-\\ncommunication can be found in section III-B.\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\x0cTABLE II\\nLIST OF ACRONYMS AND DEFINITIONS\\n\\nDefinitions\\nSmart Grid\\nSoftware-Defined Smart Grid\\nSoftware-Defined Networking\\nDistributed Denial-of-Service\\nLow Rate Denial of Service\\nInformation and Communication Technologies\\nSoftware-Defined Wireless Sensor Networks\\nHome Area Networks\\nNeighborhood Area Networks\\nWide Area Networks\\nApplication Programming Interface\\nForwarding And Control Element Separation\\nPath Computation Element Communication Protocol\\nNetwork Configuration Protocol\\nInterface to Routing System\\nFlow-Based Management Language\\nRepresentational State Transfer\\nApplication Layer Traffic Optimization\\nNicira Network Virtualization Platform\\nQuality of Service\\nOpen vSwitch Database Management\\nBlockchain\\nProtocol Oblivious Forwarding\\nPeer-to-Peer Communication\\nDeep Recurrent Neural Networks\\nBidirectional Long Short RNN\\nSupervisory Control and Data Acquisition\\nMoving Target Defense\\nIntrusion Detection Systems\\nHost IDS\\nSignature-Based IDS\\nAnomaly-Based IDS\\nMachine Learning\\nSoftware-Defined Controller Placement Camouflage\\nVirtual Security Functions\\nRandom Early Detection\\nTransmission Control Protocol\\nActive Queue Management\\nCommmand and Control Channel\\nDomain Name System\\nDynamic DNS\\nwireless sensor networks\\nmobile ad hoc networks\\nsoftware-defined data centers\\nCross-Layer Ensemble CorrDet with Adaptive Statistics\\nFalse Data Injection\\nTransmission Control Protocol-Synchronize\\nTime Synchronization Attack\\nMan-in-the-Middle\\n\\nAcronyms\\nSG\\nSD-SG\\nSDN\\nDDoS\\nLDoS\\nICT\\nSDWSNs\\nHANs\\nNANs\\nWANs\\nAPIs\\nForCES\\nPCEP\\nNetConf\\nI2RS\\nFML\\nRESTful\\nALTO\\nNVP\\nQoS\\nOVSDB\\nBC\\nPOF\\nP2P\\nRNNs\\nBiLSTM\\nSCADA\\nMTD\\nIDS\\nHIDS\\nSIDS\\nAIDS\\nML\\nSD-CPC\\nVSF\\nRED\\nTCP\\nAQM\\nC&C\\nDNS\\nDDNS\\nWSN\\nMANETs\\nSDDCs\\nCECD-AS\\nFDI\\nTCP-SYN\\nTSA\\nMITM\\n\\nB. What is software defined networking?\\n\\nSDN has taken shape in recent years and was used to\\nrepresent\\nthe ideas and techniques used for Openflow at\\nStanford University [104], [105]. SDN simply refers to the\\nnetwork architecture whereas the data plane and control plane\\nare decoupled from one another. SDN has the following\\ncharacteristics [13]:\\n\\n• Control plane and data plane are separated from one\\n\\nanother.\\n\\n• Forwarding decisions are based on flow and not destina-\\ntion. In SDN, a flow is defined as a series of packets\\nbetween the source and destination that follow a set\\n\\n5\\n\\nof instructions. The forwarding devices have the flows\\ninstalled into their flow tables by controllers.\\n\\n• The controller acts as the central logic and external entity.\\nIts job is to direct the traffic through the network and\\nmaintain the status of the network.\\n\\n• The network has the ability to be programmed through\\nsoftware applications running on top of the SDN con-\\ntroller.\\n\\n• Application programming interface (APIs) are used to\\npass information between planes of the SDN infrastruc-\\nture.\\n\\nlaunched publicly,\\n\\nAlthough SDN was first\\n\\nthe concept\\nof SDN has been evolving since 1996, with the objective\\nof enabling user-controlled management of forwarding in\\nnetwork nodes [106]. There have been numerous stepping\\nstones before the eventual creation of SDN technology as we\\nknow it today. The General Switch Management protocol in\\n1996, the Tempest (framework for programmable networks)\\nin 1998, and most recently, Ethane and OpenFlow, in 2007\\nand 2008 respectively, were necessary to make modern SDN\\na reality. Figure 2 represents an overview example of a modern\\n\\nFig. 2. General SDN Architecture\\n\\nfunctional SDN architecture. Modern SDN features include the\\nfollowing:\\n\\n• Centralized controller\\n• Separation of the control and data planes\\n• Open interface between controller and data plane\\n\\nAs shown in figure 2, the infrastructure layer is composed\\nof routers, switches, and access points. This represents the\\nphysical network equipment in the network and this layer\\nforms the data plane. The controller communicates with the\\ndata plane using southbound programming interfaces (API)\\nsuch as OpenFlow [107], ForCES [108], PCEP [109], Net-\\nConf [110], or I2RS [111]. If there is more than one con-\\ntroller present, these controllers communicate with each other\\nusing Westbound and Eastbound API such as ALTO [112] or\\n\\nMobility  ManagementLoadBalancingSecurity  MonitoringTraffic  Engineering...ApplicationController 1Controller 2Controller N...ControllerNorthbound API (e.g. Restful, FML, Pyretic, etc.) Westbound API (ALTO, Hyperflow, etc.)Eastbound API (ALTO, Hyperflow, etc.)WirelessAccess PointsSwitchesRouters...Data/InfrastructureSouthbound API (e.g. OpenFlow, ForCES, SNMP, etc.) \\x0cTABLE III\\nCOMPARISON OF SURVEY ARTICLES OF SMART GRID AND SOFTWARE DEFINED SMART GRID SECURITY\\n\\nMain Domain\\n\\nSmart Grid Security\\n\\nSoftware-Defined Smart Grid Security\\n\\nSub-Topic: Cyberattack\\n\\nDDoS/DoS/Physical-DoS (PDoS)\\nSpoofing, Sniffing, and Message Relay\\nMITM,Eavesdropping, and Homograph\\nMeter Manipulation and Theft\\nFDI\\nImpersonation, Session Key Exposure,\\nand TSA\\nTCP-SYN Flooding\\nJamming\\nRAM Exhaustation/CPU Overload\\nBrute Force\\nMessage Replay, Covert\\nSybil\\nMulti-Attack\\nDDoS/DoS\\nController\\nIntrusion\\nMulti-Attack\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n[21]–[24]\\n[25]–[28]\\n[29]–[33]\\n[34]–[37]\\n[38]–[41]\\n[42]–[47]\\n\\n[48]–[51]\\n[52]–[57]\\n[58]–[60]\\n[61]–[64]\\n[65]–[70]\\n[71]–[74]\\n[75]–[79]\\n[80]–[84]\\n[85]–[88]\\n[89]–[96]\\n[4], [97]–[101]\\n\\nHyperflow [113]. The topmost layer is the application plane.\\nIn this layer, the network operator is able to utilize functional\\napplications for various tasks such as energy efficiency, access\\ncontrol, mobility management, and/or security management.\\nThe application layer communicates with the control layer\\nusing the Northbound APIs such as FML [114], Procera [115],\\nFrenetic [116], and RESTful [112]. Depending on the desired\\nresults, the network operator can send the necessary changes\\nto the control layer using these APIs so that the controller can\\nmake necessary changes in the infrastructure layer.\\n\\nFig. 3. SDN vs. Traditional Approach for Networking\\n\\nC. SDN versus Traditional Networking\\n\\nThere are unique differences between traditional approaches\\nto networking compared to SDN. As seen in fig. 3 and\\nthe control plane and data plane are\\ndiscussed in [117],\\nconnected in the traditional network architecture while in\\nSDN the control and data plane are in a different stack. In\\nSDN, the control plane bears the responsibility to configure\\nthe nodes and defined the paths for the data flows. Once the\\npaths are determined, the controller then gives this information\\nto the data plane. However, in traditional networks, the flow\\nmanagement, or flow policy, is defined by the forwarding\\n\\n6\\n\\ndevices. The only way to change this policy is by physically\\nreconfiguring the devices themselves, which can be restrictive.\\nBecause of these hurdles, network management policies in\\ntraditional networks are not as dynamic and are difficult to\\nscale. SDN offers the ability to quickly change data flows,\\nenabling the network operator to meet the changing traffic\\ndemands.\\n\\nImportant terms to note in SDN are:\\n• Forwarding devices: These are devices that can be\\nhardware or software-based and do the routine tasks\\nfor incoming packets such as forward to specific ports,\\ndrop, or forward to the controller. They are controlled by\\nSouthbound API as shown in fig. 2.\\n\\n• Data plane: Connected forwarding devices in the network\\n\\nrepresent the Data plane.\\n\\n• Southbound API: These are the instructions that are sent\\nfrom the controller (control plane) to the switches. The\\nmost common southbound API is OpenFlow.\\n\\n• East/West API: If more than one controller is used, the\\ncontrollers communicate with each other using East/West\\nAPI. These API are used by controllers to update each\\nother on conditions and statuses of devices over which\\nthey preside. This allows the controllers to maintain a\\nglobal view of the network regardless of the topologies\\nover which the controllers maintain.\\n\\n• North Bound API: This is the communication between\\n\\nthe SDN controller and the application layer.\\n\\n• Application plane: This plane is a set of applications\\nthat set the policies of the network. An application can\\nbe routing, firewalls, load balancers, etc [118]. By using\\nnorthbound API, the application layer gives the controller\\ninstructions on what behaviors the network should follow.\\n\\nD. Data/Infrastructure Plane\\n\\nSDN and traditional networks are alike in the sense that\\nthey both contain networking equipment, such as routers and\\nswitches. The difference is that in SDN those devices no longer\\n\\nSDN RedesignTraditional NetworkSoftware-Defined NetworkNetworkSwitchData PlaneControl PlaneProgrammable NetworkSwitchSDN ControllerPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\\x0cmake autonomous decisions of forwarding like in traditional\\nnetworks. The devices act as simply forwarding devices and\\nreceive instructions on how to route traffic from the SDN\\ncontroller. This moves the intelligence of the network from\\nthe data plane devices to the controller. Furthermore, these\\nnetworks contain communication protocols and APIs (i.e.\\nOpenFlow) to ensure the right configurations of the network.\\nThis allows the SDN controller immense control and the\\nability to make adaptive changes to the network in response\\nto the demands of the network operator.\\n\\nA data plane device is a hardware or software device that\\nforwards packets through the network. An OpenFlow device\\nutilizes flow tables to direct traffic. The data in these flow\\ntables are a matching rule, actions to be executed on packets\\nthat match these rules, and counters to keep statistics of how\\nmany packets match these rules. These flow tables define what\\nwill happen to packets received to these forwarding devices.\\nWhen a new packet arrives at the forwarding device, the device\\nchecks its flow table to see if there are established instructions\\non how to properly handle the packet. If there are no flow, or\\ninstructions, in the flow table, the forwarding device will send\\nthe packet to the controller using the OpenFlow protocol for it\\nto determine what should be done with it. The controller will\\ninspect the packet and determine the appropriate forwarding\\naction.\\n\\nE. Control Plane/Controller\\n\\nThe controller layer is crucial to any SDN network and\\nprovides complete control over the network. Controllers allow\\nfor the user to control the flow of packets throughout the\\nnetwork by creating or deactivating links between nodes. The\\ncontrollers gather information from the equipment on the\\nhealth of the network. It allows for ease of network manage-\\nment by providing a central point of control for the network.\\nThe controller allows the network management with high-level\\nabstraction and APIs to developers. The controller can provide\\ninformation such as network topology, flow statistics, and\\ndevice discovery. While using an SDN controller, a developer\\ndoes not need to be concerned with low-level details of data\\ndistribution amongst forwarding devices.\\n\\nMany projects have been launched to construct controllers\\ndue to the usability and importance of controllers for the\\nSDN control plane. SDN controllers can be separated into two\\ncategories centralized vs decentralized [107] [119].\\n\\n1) Centralized: Centralized controllers were the first con-\\ntrollers to arise with the first version being NOX [120]. NOX\\nwas released in 2008 and was the first OpenFlow controller.\\nHaving a centralized controller provides numerous benefits\\ncompared to traditional networks. In traditional networks, each\\nforwarding device has very little information about the global\\nstate of the network. SDN controllers, on the other hand,\\nhave information about network topology, traffic flows, and\\nswitch load [119]. The controller sees the entire network and\\nis able to quickly deploy to manage or change any area of it.\\nIt can also route optimal paths through the network since it\\nhas a global view of the routing paths. In traditional networks,\\n\\ndevices must be added to do certain tasks such as firewalls,\\nintrusion detection, load balancing, etc., but in SDN, all of\\nthese tasks can be done by implementing an application in\\nthe application layer [119] [121]. These effectively remove\\nthe need for these devices and reduce the cost and ease\\nof implementation needed to run the network under desired\\nconstraints. In addition, a central controller makes it easy for a\\ndeveloper to apply an application to the entire network through\\none singular controller instead of having to communicate to\\nmultiple controllers in a distributed architecture.\\n\\nAlthough there are multiple advantages of using a cen-\\ntralized controller for an SDN topology,\\nthere are certain\\nlimitations and disadvantages as well. For a large wide area\\nnetwork (WAN), using a single SDN controller may not be\\nsufficient to properly maintain the network. The network will\\nexperience high control latency and bandwidth issues since one\\ncontroller has to respond to multiple nodes over a large area\\n[119]. Furthermore, as the number of nodes increases in an\\nSDN topology, these nodes will all need to communicate reg-\\nularly with the controller. This increased number of dynamic\\ncommunication, in short, the substantial bursts can overload\\na single controller. Therefore, to handle the load of a WAN,\\nit is beneficial to design a distributed approach and add more\\ncontrollers to the network.\\n\\nFig. 4. Distributed Topologies [122]\\n\\n2) Distributed: In recent years, there has been a surge of\\ninterest in distributed control plane topologies [107] [123].\\nThey have addressed several of the restrictions that central-\\nized control planes have, such as scalability, dependability\\nperformance, and single point of failure [119]. The distributed\\ncontroller SDN structure enables the control plane to respond\\nto various locations in the network in an efficient manner. It\\nenables more dynamic network control and maintenance. Fur-\\nthermore, the distributed controller’s scalability and flexibility\\nmake it perfect for WAN.\\n\\nHowever, decentralized topologies are not without\\n\\ntheir\\nchallenges. Distributed controllers use load balance and share\\nmetrics about the domains they are connected to with each\\nother. This East/West API communication as seen in fig. 2 is\\ncrucial for having a logically center, but physically distributed\\ntopology. Two examples of distributed topologies can be\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\x0cseen in Figure 4. The two distributed topologies shown are\\nhierarchical and flat models. In the hierarchical model, the\\nroot controller has global knowledge of the network and is\\nin charge of the local controllers. The local controllers do\\nnot communicate with each other in the hierarchical model.\\nOn the other hand, the flat model does not contain any root\\ncontroller and relies heavily on East/West API communication\\nto share with each other the global state of the network. In both\\nnetworks, there is a degree of difficulty that is increased when\\nthere are multiple controllers that need to communicate with\\none another. In the hierarchical model, the root controllers\\nprovide a single point of failure. In the flat model, challenges\\narise with the need for regular communication needed between\\ncontrollers to update the global state of the network [119],\\n[124].\\n\\nEast and westbound are essential in distributed SDN topolo-\\ngies. They represent the communication between controllers\\nas they update each other on the state of the network. Fig-\\nure 4 represents this communication. Import/export data across\\ncontrollers, methods for data integrity models, and monitor-\\ning/notification capabilities (e.g., check if a controller is up or\\nnotifying a take over on a set of forwarding devices) are all\\nfeatures of these interfaces [125]. East and westbound APIs are\\ncrucial to provide common compatibility and interoperations\\nbetween controllers in a system.\\n\\nF. Southbound API\\n\\nSouthbound API connects the data plane, or infrastructure,\\nwith the control plane. They provide a bridge of communi-\\ncation between the two layers. There are many southbound\\nAPIs but OpenFlow is the most widely accepted one [121].\\nIt provides a common standard and procedure for OpenFlow-\\nenabled forwarding devices and controllers. OpenFlow sup-\\nports three data streams according to [107]:\\n\\n• Event-based messages are sent to forwarding devices to\\n\\nthe controller when a link or port change happens.\\n\\n• When a link or port change occurs, event-based messages\\nare transmitted to the controller via forwarding devices.\\n• When a forwarding device is unsure what to do with\\na packet, it transmits it to the controller for additional\\nprocessing.\\n\\nAlthough OpenFlow is the most common, there are other\\navailable southbound APIs such as ForCES, OVSDB, and\\nPOF. ForCES keeps the architecture of the network the same\\nas traditional networks but still separates the control and data\\nplanes. However, it does not need a centralized controller and\\nthe control plane is updated using third-party firmware on the\\ndevices. Open vSwitch Database Management (OVSDB) has\\nmore advanced options for managing the network compared\\nto OpenFlow. It allows the user to create multiple virtual\\nswitches, set the quality of service (QoS) standards for the\\nnetwork, attach interfaces to the switches, configures tunnel\\ninterfaces on OpenFlow data paths, manages queues, and\\ncollect statistics [107]. Essentially, OVSDB is seen as a\\nmore advanced, complementary option to OpenFlow. Protocol\\n\\nOblivious Forwarding (POF) was created as a direct com-\\npetitor to OpenFlow inorder to improve the SDN forwarding\\nthe switches have to extract certain\\nplane. In OpenFlow,\\nidentifying bits to match the packet with the correct flow table\\nentry. However, this can be computationally expensive and\\nincrease complexity. POF tries to circumvent this by making\\nthe forwarding devices protocol oblivious. The forwarding\\ndevices do only processing and forwarding. Packet parsing\\nis left to the controller to do.\\n\\nG. Northbound API\\n\\nNorthbound APIs are used for the control layer to com-\\nmunicate with the application layer. There is a variety of\\ndifferent Northbound bound APIs available such as ad-hoc\\nAPIs, RESTful APIs, NVP [122], [126], [127]. The north-\\nbound interface between the controller and application layer\\nis mostly software-based unliked the southbound API which\\nis mostly hardware-based.\\n\\nH. Application Layer\\n\\nThe application layer is implemented on top of the control\\nlayer. It is responsible for giving the SDN controller com-\\nmands to implement to the data plane layer. Since SDN can\\nbe applied to a wide range of topologies and environments, it\\ncan be used for a wide range of applications, including routing\\napplications, load balancing, security enforcement, fail-over,\\nreliability functionalities in the data plane, end-to-end quality\\nof service (QoS), network virtualization, and mobility manage-\\nment in wireless networks [107]. These applications can check\\nthat SDN topologies fulfill\\nthe developer’s specifications.\\nFurthermore, these applications have made SDN appealing for\\na wide range of network requirements.\\n\\nI. SD-SG Cyberattack Threats\\n\\nResearch in the field of SD-SG security has examined a\\nvariety of different attacks. From a thorough investigation of\\nthe literature of SDN based security protocols, the main attack\\ntypes that are present in this literature fall into the following\\ncategories as shown in Figure 5:\\n\\n• Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS): DDoS/DoS at-\\ntacks are types of cyber-attacks in which the attacker\\nattempts to consume all of the server’s resources so that\\nthe server is unable to respond to legitimate requests by\\nlaunching a multi-node attack on a victim [128].\\n\\n• Controller Attacks: SD-SG controllers in SDN networks\\nare vulnerable to a variety of attacks, including DoS,\\nhijacking, unauthorized access, etc. [13], [129]. These\\nattacks seek to exploit SDN’s centralization of control\\nand disrupt the network by attacking the controller. In\\nsingular controller frameworks, the controller can serve\\nas the network’s single point of failure.\\n\\n• Intrusion Attacks: Anomaly/Intrusion attacks are cyber-\\nattacks where the attacker gains unauthorized access\\n[130]. After gaining illicit access to the system,\\nthe\\nattackers may launch other attack such as DoS, eaves-\\ndropping, controller attacks, packet manipulation, etc.\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\x0c• Multiple Attacks: Research has been developed to detect\\nmultiple attacks launched against the SD-SG such as\\nthe aforementioend attacks as well as other attack types\\nsuch as false data injection (FDI) and man-in-the-middle\\n(MITM) attacks by using a cross-layered approach. Ac-\\ncording to Allen et al. [97], FDI cyberattacks attempt\\nto deceive the control algorithm by injecting forged data\\ninto the network, whereas an MITM attack attempts to\\ngain access to the communications between two nodes\\nin a system by impersonating a node. During an MITM\\nattack, the attacker may attempt to read the contents of\\ncommunications or manipulate packets.\\n\\nIV. NETWORK SECURITY CHALLENGES OF\\nSOFTWARE-DEFINED SMART GRIDS\\n\\nThis section contains a survey that details current network\\nsecurity challenges in the form of cyberattacks on SD-SG\\nand their countermeasures. We survey and analyze DoS/DDoS\\nattacks, controller attacks, anomaly/intrusion attacks, and mul-\\ntiple attack defense techniques in current literature. An high\\nlevel overview of the taxonomy of these attacks and their\\ndefenses surveyed from literature can be seen in Figure 5.\\n\\nA. DDoS/DoS Attack Defense\\n\\nDDoS attacks can have devastating consequences for SD-SG\\n[4], [97]. These attacks can be carried out by malicious nodes\\nthat have been hijacked by attackers or by nodes that have\\ngained unauthorized access to the framework. DDoS attacks\\nhave grown in popularity among cyberattackers attacking SDN\\nframeworks [131] due to their ease of use. As a result, SD-\\nSG network operators and researchers have had to consider\\nDDoS attack mitigation strategies. The current literature and\\nefforts for DDoS attack detection and mitigation for SD-SG\\nare presented in this section and categorized based on the\\nfollowing:\\n\\n• Blockchain: Blockchain (BC) is a potential solution for\\nenforcing a verification system at every edge of SD-\\nSG’s SDN networks and addressing trust-management\\nissues in order to make the system resilient to various\\nattacks and guarantee block validation using encryption\\nor consensus mechanisms [132], [133]. BC offers a peer-\\nto-peer (P2P) communication system that keeps track of\\nevery connection-related record for each network member\\nin an easily accessible and properly kept database.\\n\\n• Machine Learning: Machine learning developed from a\\ncollection of powerful AI techniques and has been widely\\nused in data mining, allowing the system to learn useful\\nstructural patterns and models from training data, making\\nit useful for networks security [134].\\n\\n• Moving-Target Defense (MTD): MTD increases ambigu-\\nity and complexity for system attackers, decreases their\\nchances of identifying targets (e.g., vulnerable system\\ncomponents), and raises the cost of attacks and scans\\n[135]. (e.g., reconnaissance attacks).\\n\\n• SDN Attributes: SDN permits more flexibility, control,\\nand security as was stated in section III of this survey.\\n\\nResearchers have made use of these characteristics to de-\\nvelop security models for SD-SG that make use of SDN-\\nspecific characteristics such as centralized controllers,\\ncustomizable data plane flows, and natural SDN network\\nresilience.\\n\\n1) Blockchain: Xiong et al. [80] propose a SG distributed\\nsecurity architecture based on blockchain and SDN tech-\\nnology. Figure 6 shows the suggested architecture, which\\nmakes use of blockchain technology to increase security and\\ndependability. The proposed architecture employs a distributed\\nconsensus mechanism based on blockchain technology to\\nensure system integrity, prevent attacks, and provide fault\\ntolerance and scalability, among other advantages. In addition,\\nthe authors conducted a simulation experiment to assess the\\nperformance of the proposed architecture. The proposed ar-\\nchitecture and its results demonstrated that it has the potential\\nto significantly improve the safety and dependability of SD-\\nSG systems and achieve a high level of fault tolerance and\\nscalability. The blockchain-based distributed consensus mech-\\nanism was able to protect the system from DDoS attacks and\\nguarantee its integrity. During DDoS attack rates of 400 pack-\\nets/s and 1400 packets, their framework is able to maintain\\nbandwidth greater than > 80%. The study’s findings indicated\\nthat incorporating blockchain technology into SG systems has\\nthe potential to improve both security and resilience when\\nfaced with DDoS attacks.\\n\\n2) Machine Learning: Polat et al. [81] proposed an ap-\\nproach for accurately detecting DDoS attacks in SDN-based\\nSCADA systems using parallel recurrent neural networks\\n(RNNs). Their proposed method utilizes a long short-term\\nmemory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRU) RNN mod-\\nesl to classify network traffic and accurately detect DDoS\\nattacks that target SDN-based SCADA systems. The authors\\nevaluated the performance of the proposed approach using a\\nreal-world SCADA network dataset. They obtained an average\\naccuracy of 97.62% by incorporating transfer learning which\\nimproved their model performance by around 5%, demonstrat-\\ning its effectiveness in enhancing the security of SDN-based\\nSCADA systems against DDoS attacks.\\n\\nNagaraj et al. [82] proposed GLASS, a graph learning\\napproach for enhancing the security of SDN-based SG systems\\nagainst distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The pro-\\nposed method employs graph convolutional neural networks\\n(GCNNs) to detect DDoS attacks in real-time by learning the\\npatterns of normal and malicious network traffic. The authors\\ntested the proposed approach’s performance on a simulated\\nSG network and obtained a detection rate of > 97.01% and\\nmaintain throughput of 84% compared to 4% during DDoS\\nattack scenarios. The research shows that the proposed Glass\\napproach improves the security of SD-SG systems against\\nDDoS attacks.\\n\\n3) Moving Target Defense: Abdelkhalek et al. [83] pro-\\nposed a Moving Target Defense (MTD) routing mechanism\\nto improve the security of SDN-enabled SG systems. An\\nexample of a MTD is as shown in Figure 8. Their proposed\\nmechanism will randomize network topology by changing the\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\x0cFig. 5. Taxonomy of SD-SG Network Security: Cyberattacks and Defense Techniques\\n\\npaths that network flows take on in response to an attack which\\nwill make it difficult for attackers to launch successful DoS\\nattacks. The authors evaluated the performance of the proposed\\nmechanism using a simulated SG network demonstrate the\\nbenefits of using MTD-based routing in an SDN WAN, which\\nhas significantly reduced packet drop percentages. Researchers\\nconcluded that a link switching time of 5 seconds was optimal\\nfor minimizing packet drops during DoS attacks as shown in\\nFigure 7.\\n\\n4) SDN Attributes: Mahmood et al. [84] present S-DPs,\\nan SDN-based DDoS protection system that can provide SG\\nsecurity. To protect the network, the proposed system employs\\na centralized controller to monitor the network and detect\\nand classify the DDoS attacks based on employing light-\\nweight Tsallis entropy-based defense mechanisms, and apply\\ncountermeasures such as rate limiting and filtering. The S-\\nDPs system was evaluated by the authors in a simulated\\nSG environment with various attack scenarios. The results\\ndemonstrated that the system can detect and mitigate DDoS\\nattacks with up to 100% accuracy with a 0% false positive rate.\\nAccording to the authors, the proposed system can provide an\\n\\nefficient and effective approach to protecting SG from DDoS\\nattacks.\\n\\n5) Final Thoughts for DDoS/DoS Attack Defense: DDoS\\nattacks pose a serious threat to SD-SG systems and are increas-\\ningly being used by cyber attackers due to their ease of use. To\\nmitigate these attacks, several strategies have been proposed,\\nincluding the use of blockchain technology, deep recurrent\\nneural networks, access control and rate limiting, distributed\\nsoftware-defined networking architecture, and graph learning\\napproaches. These strategies have yielded promising results\\nin terms of improving SD-SG system security against DDoS\\nattacks.\\n\\nB.

This section examines SD-\\nSG controller attack defense strategies and categorized them\\nbased on game theory and MTD. In this section, we consider\\nMTD as described in section IV-A, and we define game theory\\nas follows:\\n\\n• Game Theory: Designers use models to analyze data and\\nexperiences. According to game theory, multi-decision\\nscenarios are games in which each player makes decisions\\nthat maximize their own benefits while anticipating the\\nrational choices of their fellow participants (attackers)\\n[137]. In game theory, the participant makes decisions\\nand takes actions to produce the desired, ideal result.\\n\\nFig. 8. Moving Target Defense Example Architecture\\n\\nIn order to obtain the best result of improved network\\nsecurity, SD-SG security studies use gaming theory to\\nevaluate threat scenarios and use the control and data\\nplanes as players.\\n\\n1) Game Theory: Sivaraman et al. [85] propose a game-\\ntheoretic approach to improving data privacy in SD-SG, with\\nthe goal of reducing passive information leakage through\\ncompromised controllers. The proposed privacy framework is\\nbased on the formulation of a noncooperative game among\\nthe switches. The requirements for privacy are quantified using\\ninformation theory mutual information and differential privacy.\\nAn iterative best response algorithm is used to compute\\nthe game’s Nash equilibrium [138]. The proposed scheme’s\\nperformance is compared to the globally optimal solution\\nand the exponential mechanism (for differential privacy).When\\n\\n11\\n\\nHost 1Host 2Host 3AttackerControllerEnabled Link for Authorized TrafficFalseLink for Attack TrafficSouthbound APIsPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\\x0ccompared to the global solutions, the theoretical game per-\\nformed nearly optimally on the IEEE 30, 118, and 300 [139]\\nbus systems. In practice, the proposed approach can be used\\nto improve data privacy in SG systems and protect against\\ncompromised controllers.\\n\\nSamir et al. [86] suggest a Software-Defined Controller\\nPlacement Camouflage (SD-CPC), a stochastic game-based\\nMTD method for improving SDN controller resilience against\\ncyber threats. Figure 9 shows a model of a game-based MTD.\\nThe technique seeks to make SDN controllers less vulnerable\\nto attackers by dynamically relocating virtualized controllers\\nand changing their IP addresses. There are two participants in\\nthe game: player 1 is the system defender, and player 2 is the\\nattacker. The attacker targeted the most vulnerable regions of\\nthe network in their simulations, while the system defender\\nlocation to migrate the controllers in\\ndetermined the best\\nreaction. The technique performed particularly well against\\nattacks that tried to exploit vulnerabilities in the controller’s\\nsoftware or targeted the controller’s location. The proposed\\ngame had minmal influence on system performance, and the\\nproposed SD-CPC approach offers an effective and efficient\\nMTD solution for improving SDN resilience to advanced\\npersistent threats to controllers.\\n\\n2) Moving-Target Defense: Lin et al. [87] proposes a Mov-\\ning Target Defense (MTD) approach based on virtual security\\nfunctions (VSF) (e.g. firewalls, IDS, traffic classifier, etc.) to\\nimprove the security of SDN networks in SG. Furthermore, re-\\nsearchers suggest mitigrating the VSF to resource-rich servers\\nwill help mitigate the effects on the VSF. The approach aims\\nto defend against controller attacks by proposing a moving\\ntarget defense of SD-SG based on a proposed security function\\nvirtualization (SFV), making it difficult for attackers to locate\\nand exploit vulnerabilities. The authors used a simulation\\nof a real-world SG topology to assess the effectiveness of\\nthe proposed approach. According to the findings, SFV-based\\nMTD can reduce the success rate of various attacks. The\\nmethod worked especially well against attacks that targeted\\nthe controller’s location or attempted to exploit vulnerabilities\\nin the controller’s software. Their proposed algorithm achieves\\nthe maximum available resource increment, whereas other\\npopular algorithms, random and greedy algorithms, achieve\\nlesser performance. The proposed approach, SFV-based MTD,\\noffers a practical and cost-effective solution for improving the\\nsecurity of SDN-enabled SG.\\n\\nAzab et al. [88] proposes ”MystifY,” a proactive Moving-\\nTarget Defense (MTD) approach for improving the resilience\\nof Software Defined Control Plane in Software Defined Cyber-\\nPhysical Systems (SD-CPS) against attacks. The strategy aims\\nthreats by changing\\nto defend against advanced persistent\\nthe controller’s network addresses and/or ports on a regular\\nbasis, making it difficult for attackers to track the controller’s\\nlocation and exploit vulnerabilities. The authors implemented\\nMystifY on a testbed and assessed its efficacy against various\\ntypes of attacks. According to the findings, MystifY can\\nreduce the success rate of various attacks by not allowing the\\nattacker to identify the location or identify of the controller.\\n\\nThe method worked especially well against attacks that tar-\\ngeted the controller’s network location or attempted to exploit\\nvulnerabilities in the controller’s software. Furthermore, the\\nauthors assessed the proposed approach’s impact on SD-CPS\\nperformance in terms of network latency, packet loss, and\\nthroughput. MystifY had a negligible impact on system perfor-\\nmance. Finally, the proposed approach, MystifY, provides an\\neffective and efficient proactive MTD solution for improving\\nthe SD-CPS’s resilience to advanced persistent threats. The\\napproach achieves a high level of security while having little\\nimpact on system performance.\\n\\n3) Final Thoughts for Controller Attack Defense: Con-\\ntrollers, which manage the network and send flows to forward-\\ning devices, are an essential component of SDN frameworks.\\nTo prevent cyber attacks, SD-SG network operators must\\ndevise methods to secure controllers. To improve the re-\\nsilience of SDN networks against advanced persistent threats,\\nseveral moving target defense (MTD) approaches, such as\\ngame-theoretic and stochastic game-based methods, have been\\nproposed. MTD approaches involve regularly changing the\\ncontroller’s network addresses and/or ports to make it difficult\\nfor attackers to track its location and exploit vulnerabilities.\\nBy moving VSF to resource-rich servers, MTD approaches\\nbased on virtual security functions (VSF) can also mitigate\\nthe effects of attacks.\\n\\nC. Intrusion Attack Defense\\n\\nIn the ideal scenario, the SD-SG is expected to be ac-\\ncessed through authorized entities to meet the three main\\ncyber-security goals of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and\\navailability. However, SD-SG vulnerabilities occur as a result\\nof unauthorized access due to intrusion attacks such as false\\ndata injection, ARP spoofing, DoS, and host location attacks\\n[1]. For this reason, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are\\nsolutions that detect and report\\nthese attacks. Figure 10\\nillustrates the integration of IDS as an application residing\\nin the SDN architecture. The SDN controller receives flow\\nstatistics from the OpenFlow switch and sends them to the\\nIDS, which uses a data processing technique for anomaly\\ndetection. The generated report on the traffic flow statistics\\nis sent from the IDS to the SDN controller, which updates\\nthe flow rule in the switch to either drop or forward packets\\nbased on the received report. IDS can also reside either in\\nthe controller or hypervisor and this has been demonstrated\\nin [93], [96]. IDS as shown in figure 11 is mainly classified\\nas Host IDS (HIDS) and Network IDS (NIDS). HIDS runs\\non a network device to observe the behavior of other network\\ndevices while the NIDS analyzes network traffic [140]. NIDS\\ncontributes to analyzing SDN traffic flow to identify intrusion\\nattacks. Hence, this section focuses on the proposed detection\\ntechniques in NIDS. Based on how data is processed for attack\\ndetection, IDS can be further categorized as Signature-based\\nand Anomaly-based. The Signature-based IDS (SIDS) detects\\nknown intrusion attacks using known traffic patterns. Although\\nit is able to correctly detect known attacks with a low false\\npositive rate, it is unable to classify unknown attacks and has\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\x0cFig. 9. SD-SD MTD Game Example\\n\\na high false alarm rate. In the Anomaly-based IDS (AIDS),\\nit detects intrusion attacks through deviations from normal\\nbehavior. Hence, it is able to detect unknown abnormalities.\\nThe proposed approaches for implementing SIDS and AIDS\\nas defense strategies against intrusion attacks are categorized\\nand discussed as follows.\\n\\n• Rule-based SIDS: SIDS utilizes the rule-based technique\\nwhich comprises conditional if-then rules to enable prede-\\nfined signatures to identify known intrusion attacks [141].\\nThese rules are easy to create and lightweight. Snort is\\nan open-source rule-based SIDS. It operates by matching\\npackets with the signature database and if there is a rule\\nmatch, Snort generates an intrusion attack alert [142].\\n• Machine Learning: Machine Learning (ML) techniques\\nare used in AIDS for detecting intrusion attacks. It utilizes\\nmathematical models to extract useful patterns from data\\nsets. ML algorithms can be classified as Supervised\\nor Unsupervised. Supervised ML uses labeled data for\\ntraining to map an input variable to a target variable while\\nUnsupervised ML identifies patterns from unlabelled data\\nby grouping them based on similarities [143]. Examples\\nof ML algorithms include K-Nearest Neighbor, Support\\nVector Machine, K-mean clustering, and Ensemble meth-\\nods.\\n\\n• Deep Learning: Deep Learning (DL) is based on artificial\\nneural networks and uses multiple hidden layers to extract\\nhigh-level features from data sets. Deep learning has\\ngreat feature learning capabilities and has recently been\\nproposed to be efficiently applicable for IDS [94], [95].\\nDL can be supervised or unsupervised. Examples of DL\\nalgorithms include Recurrent Neural Networks, Convolu-\\ntional Neural Networks, and Deep Neural Networks.\\n• Game Theory: Game theory uses mathematical models\\nfor strategic interactions among players such that payoffs\\n\\nare interdependent on each other’s actions in instances\\nlike attack-defense scenarios. Also, other SDN-related\\nproblems like SDN controller assignment, and intrusion\\ndetection and mitigation can be modeled as games [96].\\n\\n1) Rule-based SIDS: Presently, zero-day intrusion attacks\\nare continually on the rise, and the Signature-based IDS\\nis unable to detect these attacks since it uses the classical\\nsupervised machine learning techniques or rule-based methods\\nwhich can only determine similarities in known attacks [144].\\nThis is demonstrated in [89], where Pedro et. al proposes a\\nDDoS attack detection and mitigation technique that integrates\\nan IDS with an SDN architecture. The authors implement the\\nSnort IDS, which uses known rule-based signatures to detect\\nintrusion attacks namely DDoS, DDoS with IP spoofing, and\\nDDoS with IP packet size manipulation. The proposed method\\noperates in three phases which are the detection, communi-\\ncation, and mitigation phases. The Snort IDS detects DDoS\\nattacks in the detection phase and alerts the SDN controller\\nthe detected intrusion attack in the communication\\nabout\\nphase. In the mitigation phase, the SDN controller installs\\nsome flow rules in the switch to block the intrusion attack.\\nThe experimental results indicate that implementing the Snort\\nIDS based on the SDN paradigm mitigates DDoS attacks while\\nmaintaining the normal operation of a network. However, the\\nauthors used a single Ryu controller which makes the entire\\nnetwork susceptible to a single point of failure. Moreover,\\nthe Snort IDS is a Signature-based IDS that detects known\\nintrusion attacks correctly but has a high false alarm rate\\nin identifying unknown intrusion attacks and mutations in\\nknown attacks. A potential solution that has attracted research\\nattention is the use of Game Theory, ML, and DL algorithms\\nfor Anomalous-based IDS [90].\\n\\n2) Machine Learning: Detecting intrusion attacks in the\\nSD-SG is very crucial. Due to this, researchers have put in\\n\\n13\\n\\nController MigrationVirtualizedController Starting LocationVirtualizedControllerMigratedLocationServerServerHostHostHostPlayer 2: AttackerPlayer 1: System Defender\\x0cFig. 10.\\n\\nIDS Integration in SD-SG Architecture\\n\\nthis proposed method has not been validated to confirm its\\nefficiency in effectively detecting intrusion attacks in SD-SG.\\nAccording to the analysis conducted in [92], IDS solutions\\nbased on a single machine learning model encounter issues\\nlike poor generalization and ineffective detection of all attack\\ntypes. Zakaria et al. design BoostIDS which is a novel\\nframework that\\nleverages ensemble learning to efficiently\\ndetect and mitigate security threats like DDoS, probe, fuzzers,\\nand backdoor attacks in SD-SG. BootIDS is deployed as an\\napplication in the application plane of the SDN architecture\\nas shown in Figure 10 and consists of two modules. The first\\nmodule uses Boosting Feature Selection algorithm to select\\nrelevant SG features. The second module uses a Lightweight\\nBoosting algorithm to effectively detect intrusion attacks in an\\nSD-SG. The experimental results prove that the BoostIDS has\\nhigher precision, accuracy, detection rate, and f1-score when\\ncompared with existing machine learning intrusion detection\\nsystems.\\n\\nAllen et al. [93] propose a Hybrid, Distributed, and De-\\ncentralized (HDD) SDN architecture to secure the Phasor\\nMeasurement Unit (PMU) subsystem network. HDD-SDN\\nutilizes the physically distributed controller approach for fault\\ntolerance and fail-over operations while employing the parallel\\nexecution of machine learning models to detect anomalous\\nbehavior for a resilient SD-SG. The proposed method uses the\\nparent-child multiple controllers model. The parent controller\\nre-configures the network and allocates and manages resources\\nwhereas the child controller determines anomalies in packets\\n\\nFig. 11.\\n\\nIntrusion Detection System Description\\n\\nmuch work to address this problem by proposing Anomalous-\\nbased IDS solutions in defense against intrusion attacks. In\\n[91], the authors assert that Entropy-based Anomaly Detection\\nmethods that make use of feature distributions of the network\\nhave been successful in detecting intrusion attacks like DoS.\\nOn this account, they propose the Shannon Entropy to identify\\nanomalies such as DoS and network scanning intrusion attacks\\nin the communication network of an SG using SDN traffic\\nfeature distributions like source Internet Protocol (IP) address\\nand destination IP address. A high entropy implies scattering\\nof the feature distribution whereas a low entropy indicates\\nconvergence of the feature distribution. Principal Component\\nAnalysis (PCA) is used for pre-processing the traffic flow\\nbefore classification. However, this is ongoing research and\\nthe authors expect to implement this proposed entropy-based\\nanomaly detection technique on an SDN-based testbed. Thus,\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\x0cand monitors the status of the parent node and other devices\\nwithin the sub-region network. The authors implement the K-\\nmeans algorithm in parallel with the incremental K-means\\nalgorithm. The standard K-means algorithm recalculates the\\ncluster centers using the entire data set while the incremental\\nK-means updates the previous centers with only newly input\\ndata in each iteration. These clustering techniques detect\\nanomalies in the network traffic data and PMU measurement\\ndata. The proposed anomaly detection technique using clus-\\ntering provides approximately 90% accuracy.\\n\\n3) Deep Learning: A Hybrid Convolutional Neural Net-\\nwork (HYBRID-CNN) is proposed in [94] to identify abnor-\\nmal flow due to intrusion attacks such as scan, DoS, Root to\\nLocal (R2L), probe, and User to Root (U2R) attacks in SD-SG.\\nThe proposed method uses a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to\\nmemorize global features whereas the Convolutional Neural\\nNetwork generalizes local features for better feature learning\\ncapabilities. Although the HYBRID-CNN effectively detects\\nabnormal data flow with a good detection rate, it is biased\\ntoward some attack classes. This is due to the unbalanced\\ndata sets used in the implementation. However, it provides\\nbetter results than the compared traditional and deep learning\\nmethods.\\n\\nAlfan et al. in [95] propose CyResGrid, an approach that\\nuses a hybrid deep learning model of a Graph Convolutional\\nLong-Short Term Memory (GC-LSTM) and a deep convo-\\nlutional network for time-series classification-based anomaly\\ndetection in Operational Technology (OT) communication\\nnetworks for power grids. GC-LSTM comprises two ma-\\nchine learning models, namely, Graph Convolutional Network\\n(GCN) and LSTM. The GCN processes the OT network\\ninformation in the spatial domain. The LSTM\\ntopological\\nlearns the time-series data of the observed OT network traffic\\nin the temporal domain. Hence, GC-LSTM is able to learn\\nfrom both the spatial and temporal domains. The deep con-\\nvolutional network in CyResGrid uses Bayesian optimization\\nfor hyperparameter tuning to detect anomalies. The authors\\nsimulated the power system in real-time with the Root Mean\\nSquare (RMS) dynamic model of the IEEE 39-bus test sys-\\ntem in DIgSILENT PowerFactory whereas the OT network\\nemulation is based on Mininet. They considered DDoS and\\nactive reconnaissance which involves OT network scanning as\\nintrusion attacks. The experimental analysis indicates that the\\nproposed CyResGrid outperforms the compared state-of-the-\\nart deep learning-based time-series classification of intrusion\\nattacks. CyResGrid can be improved to detect more variations\\nof intrusion attacks in the SD-SG.\\n\\n4) Game Theory: Although the virtualized SDNs (vSDNs)\\nprovide better network management and programmability, they\\nare associated with security problems that affect the normal\\noperation of the SG. Rumaisa et al. formulate the strategic\\ninteraction between a hypervisor monitoring its vSDN con-\\ntrollers and a possible attack source launching DDoS intru-\\nsion attacks via compromised switches as a non-cooperative\\ndynamic Bayesian game-theoretic IDS [96]. Figure 12 illus-\\ntrates the four scenarios considered in the paper for strategic\\n\\nFig. 12. Scenarios for Strategic Interactions between a Hypervisor and an\\nAttacker [96]\\n\\ninteractions between a hypervisor and an attacker launching\\nDDoS through compromised switches. The proposed game\\nmodel enables a hypervisor to distribute its limited resources\\nto optimally monitor guest virtualized SDN controllers. In\\naddition, the model provides accurate detection by address-\\ning the realistic approach of a malicious entity, which via\\na compromised switch aims to minimize its detection by\\ndeviating its behavior between a normal and a malicious\\nentity. The simulation results indicate that the non-cooperative\\ndynamic Bayesian game-theoretic IDS enables a hypervisor\\nto increase the probability of detecting distributed attacks,\\nminimizes false positives, and reduces monitoring costs since\\nresources allocations to monitor virtualized SDN controllers\\ndepend upon its belief about the source of the attacks that it\\nforms based on its observation.\\n\\n5) Final Thoughts for Intrusion Attack Defense: Intrusion\\nattacks in SD-SG are becoming more complex and their\\nmutation feature makes it difficult to identify them using intru-\\nsion detection systems like the Signature-based IDS. Moving\\nforward, current research addresses intrusion attacks by using\\nthe Anomalous-based IDS which leverages techniques like\\nmachine learning, deep learning, and graph theory. Most\\nrecent works are geared toward the use of deep learning\\nalgorithms in IDS since these methods have proven to be more\\nefficient in identifying different intrusion attacks in the SD-SG.\\nMoreover, ensemble learning and hybrid models are utilized\\nas well to improve performances in detecting intrusion attacks\\ncompared to a single ineffective learning model. A common\\nchallenge experienced in the aforementioned literature is the\\nunavailability and imbalance of data sets to implement and\\nevaluate an IDS in the SD-SG. This makes it difficult for IDS\\nmodels to effectively detect intrusion attacks.\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\x0cFig. 13. Cross-Layer Cyber-Physical Security Architecture Presented in [97]\\n\\nD. Multi-Attack Defense\\n\\nThe threshold equation for the CECD-AS Algorithm:\\n\\nAt the University of Florida, our previous works [4], [97]–\\n[101] have developed security frameworks for SD-SGs. Our\\npublications [4], [97] have focused on the detection of multiple\\ncyberattacks using the proposed Cross-Layer Ensemble Cor-\\nrDet with Adaptive Statistics (CECD-AS) strategy to provide\\na robust, comprehensive framework that can detect various\\ncyberattack threats such as FDI, DoS, and MITM attacks. In\\nthis section, we provide further discussion of the CECD-AS\\nframework and performance analysis as well as survey our\\nwork literature that expands upon this framework.\\n\\n1) Cross-Layered Machine Learning Approach: Allen et al.\\n[97] present a cross-layered approach that aims at protecting\\nSGs against cyber threats by incorporating data from the power\\ngrid and communication layers for ML model training and\\ntesting to safeguard the grid from multiple cyberattacks such\\nas FDI, DoS, and MITM attacks. An overview of the proposed\\narchitecture can be seen in Figure 13. It utilizes data-driven\\nML techniques such as the CECD-AS algorithm to analyze\\ndata from the power grid and SDN-communication layers and\\ndetect any anomalous behavior in real-time in the SD-SG\\nas shown in Procedure 1.

The research demonstrated that\\na real-time CECD-AS approach outperforms state-of-the-art\\nSE methodologies in terms of F1-score for a variety of cyber\\nattacks by > 200% due to its ability to learn from data\\ncollected in multiple layers of SG and adapt to dynamic spatio-\\ntemporal changes in measurement data.\\n\\nOther works have developed and extended the SDN archi-\\ntecture layer of the CECD-AS approach to a flat, distributed\\ndesign for DoS cyberattack resiliency while utilizing the\\nCECD-AS for multiple attack detection.

If one controller\\ngoes offline, the other controllers replace and take control\\nof the network for the down controller which significantly\\nimproves the SG’s resilience to outages in the control layer and\\nload management. A subsequent benchmarking study [147]\\nis conducted to compare the performance of the proposed\\narchitecture with another common controller solution in SD-\\nSG research,\\nthe POX controller [84], [150], [151]. The\\nproposed D3-SDN architecture outperforms a single SDN\\ncontroller framework by increasing throughput by ten times,\\nreducing latency > 20%, and increasing throughput during\\nDoS attack situations by approximately 11%.\\n\\n2) Final Thoughts for Multi-Attack Defense: SD-SG can\\nbecome subjected to multiple varying cyberattacks such as\\nFDI, MITM, DoS. At the University of Florida, we have\\ndeveloped ML algorithms and cross-layered strategies to detect\\nthese attacks with greater performance than other state-of-the-\\nart methods. In addition, we have developed and proposed\\nnovel D3-SDN for SD-SG communication layer to mitigate\\nrisk to cyberattacks.\\n\\nV. UNSOLVED CHALLENGES\\n\\nAs SD-SG continues to grow as a critical infrastructure for\\ndelivering power and energy to customers, new challenges\\nemerge. One challenge is resiliency, which is defined as\\nhow quickly a network can recover victimized nodes and\\nrestore connectivity to end users in the event of a cyberattack.\\nDoS attacks pose a significant risk to the resilience of these\\nnetworks. As previously stated, these kinds of attacks can be\\nconducted to flood target nodes or components in the SD-SG\\nin order to harm or fully shut them down. As stated in Sec-\\ntion IV-A, various solutions against DDoS/DoS attacks have\\nbeen proposed, including blockchain, machine learning, SDN\\nproperties, and moving target defenses. Blockchain approaches\\ncan increase network security by validating network traffic\\nand the behavior of nodes. However, they require recording,\\nstoring, and validating the blockchain process which can add\\noverhead and strain to the system. A lightweight blockchain\\narchitecture capable of protecting an SD-SG from DDoS/DoS\\nattacks and providing recovery of nodes has yet to be created.\\nML models can be taught to detect DDoS/DoS threats, but they\\nfail when it comes to detecting DDoS/DoS attacks launched\\nusing zero-day exploits or techniques that the model has yet\\nto be trained and tested on. As a result, trained ML solutions\\nneed to be consistently updated with the latest data available\\nwhich may not be feasible. In addition, a robust ML model\\nthat can detect novel DDoS/DoS attacks and provide recovery\\nsolutions for victimized nodes remains to be observed. Other\\nresearch has focused on using SDN properties such as utilizing\\nthe controller’s global view of the network to provide detection\\nand mitigation for smurf attacks, sock stress attacks, and SYN\\nflood attacks by employing lightweight Tsallis entropy-based\\ndefense mechanisms. Although these tactics are effective for\\ndetecting and mitigating these attacks, they do not recover\\nnodes that have gone down because of DDoS/DoS attacks or\\nhijacked nodes used to launch DDoS/DoS attacks. Instead,\\n\\nit focuses on denying port access for identified attacker\\nnodes, which unavoidably causes certain nodes to become\\nunavailable, allowing the DDoS/DoS attack to succeed. The\\ndemand for a controller centralization technique capable of\\nrecovering fallen nodes remains unfulfilled. Other strategies\\nhave used moving target defensive techniques that focus\\non randomizing link pathways to make DDoS/DoS attacks\\nsuccessful. Although the links are allowed to change on a\\nregular basis, making it more difficult for the attacker to\\nlaunch a DoS attack, continually changing network topology\\nmay result in increased overhead and strain on the controller,\\nlowering overall network performance. A strategy that allows\\nfor moving target defense while also providing node recovery\\nhas yet to be developed. In summary, these tactics largely focus\\non detection, prevention, and mitigation rather than recovery\\nof downed nodes, making the DDoS/DoS attack’s ultimate\\npurpose effective. The unsolved task of recovering fallen nodes\\nand regaining those nodes with minimal overhead and strain\\non the SD-SG network infrastructure remains.\\n\\nThe capacity to protect the privacy of data shared within\\nthe SD-SG presents an additional challenge. The privacy\\nrisk of these networks is significantly increased by controller\\nattacks. As previously stated, such attacks can be leveraged\\nto take unauthorized control of the SDN controller, which\\nhas entire network authority. The SDN controller can be used\\nby attackers to monitor data transmission and, if necessary,\\ndivert traffic to hostile hosts. As mentioned in Section IV-B,\\na number of defenses against controller attacks have been put\\nforth, including moving-target defense and game theory. With\\nthe aid of game theory, developers create games in which\\nthe security system (a player) must make several decisions in\\norder to achieve a predetermined objective, such as protecting\\nthe controller from an attacker (another player). Although\\ngame theory can be used to improve controller security and\\navoid data leakage to ensure data privacy, its implementation\\ninside a system can result\\nin additional system overhead.\\nFurthermore, a reliable method that can identify both a com-\\npromised controller and the attacker who launched the attack\\nhas not yet been developed. If the controller and attacker were\\nidentified, more effective and precise security measures may\\nbe taken. Other studies have concentrated on moving target\\ndefense methods such as changing the controllers’ various\\nports to confuse attackers or relocating the controller through\\nthe use of software. These techniques can continuously alter\\nthe topology, which would be a deterrent to attackers, but\\nthey would necessitate regular synchronization of routing\\nlogic across the network to ensure proper communication\\ndelivery due to continuously fluctuating communication links.\\nFurthermore, it has not yet been realized that a moving target\\ndefense can recognize a compromised controller and/or the\\nattacker. In conclusion, these strategies primarily aim to stop\\ncontroller attacks in order to prevent the controller(s) from\\nbeing compromised and leaking data. However, the unresolved\\nissue of identifying which controller(s) are compromised,\\nas well as the identity of the attacker, remains unresolved.\\nTherefore, mitigation techniques for IDS techniques remain\\n\\n18\\n\\n\\x0can unsolved issue.\\n\\nIt is important for the SD-SG to guarantee reliability in\\nits communication infrastructure by ensuring that very few\\ncyber attacks work with little or no impact using fast recovery\\nmechanisms for sustainable and continuous provisioning of\\nservices with no interruptions. However,\\nintrusion attacks,\\nwhich are launched by intruders through unauthorized access\\nto disrupt the normal operation of the SD-SG make it difficult\\nto provide reliability. Hence, this still remains a major problem\\nin SD-SG, although several literature reviews on counteracting\\nintrusion attacks using IDS have been discussed in Section\\nIV-C. From the discussions, the Signature-based IDS using\\nrule-based methods are efficient in detecting known DDoS\\nintrusion attacks with low response time complexities but are\\ninefficient in detecting new or mutating forms of intrusion\\nattacks. To combat this problem, ML and DL solutions have\\nbeen explored and applied in IDSs. The Machine learning\\nand Deep learning IDS based on a single model have poor\\ngeneralization for complex intrusion attack detection. Most\\nresearch done to resolve this problem involves combining\\ntwo or more ML and/or DL models, and this has proven to\\nbe very effective in detecting intrusion attacks. However, the\\nunavailability and unbalance of real-world datasets strongly\\ninfluence the performance of ML and/or DL IDS solutions.\\nMoreover, the availability of these datasets and their direct\\nexposure to the wrong hands of malicious users can breach\\nthe privacy of these sensitive data and introduce more complex\\nintrusion attacks. To tackle this problem for the performance\\nimprovement of ML and/or DL-based IDS to ensure a reliable\\nSD-SG, there is the need to explore more mechanisms that\\nreduce the constraints with training data availability or imbal-\\nance, and these methods include transfer learning, federated\\nlearning, and data augmentation. The communication network\\ntraffic has dynamic patterns, which could be associated with\\ninstances such as a change in the network topology or users’\\nservice demands. Subsequently, the data training phase of ML\\nand/or DL-based IDS continually has to update its dataset\\nfor training to adapt to the dynamic network traffic. Utilizing\\nadvanced online training algorithms and automated updates\\nof the ML and/or DL-based IDS depending on the network\\ntraffic pattern remains an important research area that can\\nbe explored to provide reliability in SD-SG. The reviewed\\nresearch mostly considers a single SDN controller for updating\\nflow rules, and intrusion attacks on this controller cause single\\npoint of failure vulnerabilities resulting in a total shutdown\\nof the communication network. On the other hand, other\\nresearch works utilize multiple controllers to overcome this\\nissue to ensure fast failovers to sustain normal operations.\\nAlthough the use of more than one SDN controller improves\\nthe reliability of the SD-SG, it presents open research areas\\nsuch as reducing SDN control overheads, optimally placing\\nand allocating resources to SDN controllers, synchronizing\\nthe network states among SDN controllers, and selecting a\\ncluster head from a cluster of SDN controllers. An underlying\\nunsolved problem is that the discussed literature focuses more\\non intrusion attack detection and further work is required on\\n\\nnot only detecting complex intrusion attacks but mitigating\\nthese attacks within an optimal time for reliability in the time-\\ncritical SD-SGs.\\n\\nAs researchers continue to develop unique models and\\nmethods to defend SD-SG against attacks, the challenge of\\nadaptability, or defense methods that are not rigidly con-\\nfigured, arises. To genuinely provide a holistic defensive\\napproach against attackers, researchers must examine how\\nflexible their solutions are to numerous attack types and\\nscenarios. Unbeknownst to network defenders, attackers can\\nperform a number of cyberattacks against an SD-SG. A\\nsignificant portion of current research focuses on specialized\\nSD-SG defense strategies for specific attacks. However, as\\nnoted in Section IV-D, there is a new area of SD-SG research\\nfocusing on the creation of multi-attack defensive solutions\\nthat evaluate data from both physical and network SD-SG\\ncomponents. These solutions primarily employ cross-layered\\nmachine learning algorithms that combine cross-layered en-\\nsemble learning methods with correlation detectors to dynami-\\ncally update the statistical model or parameters based on power\\nflow traffic for improved detection of multiple attacks. Cross-\\nlayered machine learning algorithms including CECD-AS and\\nECD-AS incorporate data from both the power grid and the\\nnetwork layer to detect multiple threats (i.e. DDoS, FDI, and\\nMITM) and react to changes in network state. Although these\\nsystems can detect many threats, they are data-driven and must\\nbe regularly updated with data from various sources. These\\nstrategies necessitate data collection from both the power\\ngrid and network layers, which may add overhead to SD-\\nSG operations. Furthermore, the model’s failure to recognize\\nattacks that it has not seen or trained for remains an unresolved\\nissue. Therefore, the unsolved challenge of a robust defense\\nmodel for a multi-cyberattack solution capable of detecting\\nnovel or unforeseen attacks has not yet been realized.\\n\\nA. Emerging Threats to SD-SG Security\\n\\nSD-SG network security techniques have continued to be\\ndeveloped, but attackers are developing new techniques to\\ncircumvent them. In the next subsections, we examine emerg-\\ning potential threats to SD-SG network security in the form\\nof cyberattacks that have yet to be researched for SD-SG\\nand provide potential solutions offered for these attacks in\\nother SDN security literature. As shown in Figure 5,\\nthe\\nemerging threats to SD-SG network security research are\\nthe following: Low Rate Denial-of-Service (LDoS) Attacks,\\nController Impersonation Attacks, and Black Hole Attacks.\\n\\n1) Low Rate Denial-of-Service (LDoS) Attack: LDoS at-\\ntacks are stealthier version of the violent nature of DDoS\\nattacks [152]. LDoS attacks send low-rate traffic to a target\\ndevice or network over a long period of time. LDoS attacks\\nconsume network bandwidth, computing power, and memory\\nto degrade the target’s performance or availability. LDoS\\nattacks are intended to avoid detection and avoid flooding the\\ntarget system or network with traffic. LDoS attacks can avoid\\nintrusion detection systems and other security measures that\\nspot high-volume attacks by sending low-volume traffic via\\n\\n19\\n\\n\\x0cshort burst of packets over time. Over time this can degrade\\nthe QoS of a node while avoiding detection.\\n\\nCurrently, defense methods of LDoS attacks involve filtering\\nLDoS attacks, improving network parameters, and reallocation\\nof resources [152]. Researchers used the comb filter to filter\\nLDoS attacks from transmission control protocol (TCP) traffic\\nby analyzing the amplitude spectrum to determine periodic\\nparameters of the LDoS attack [153]. Other Researchers have\\nemployed using the random early detection (RED) algorithm\\nwhich is an active queue management (AQM) method de-\\nployed on the router. The RED algorithm avoids congestion\\nby pre-emptively dropping packets before the router’s bufer\\nbecomes full. Research efforts [154], [155] have deployed\\nmodified variations of RED and AQM methods on routers\\nto detect LDoS attacks. Other efforts [156] have deployed\\nmachine learning models based on Q-learning to dynamically\\nallocate resources as needed. Imtegration of these algorithms\\nand methods could find vitality in SD-SG network security\\nresearch.\\n\\n2) Controller Botnet Attacks: Botnets are malware-infected\\nzombie networks that are controlled by a single master called\\nthe botmaster. A botnet is comprised of the following el-\\nements: bots, botmaster and command and control channel\\n(C&C) [157]. Bots are malware-infected computers that com-\\npose the botnet network and can number in the hundreds of\\nthousands. The C&C channel is a server that is responsible\\nfor disseminating commands and receiving information for\\nlater access by the botmaster. With control of the botnet,\\nthe botmaster can initiate cyberattacks, disseminate spam or\\nmalware, conduct ransom attacks, steal personal information,\\netc. and cause millions in damages [157]. A botnet architecture\\nis shown in Figure 15. Additionally, botmasters may offer\\ninfected computers to other hackers for use in their own\\nattacks. Because of their crucial role in network governance\\nas aforementioned, SDN controllers are desirable targets for\\nbotmasters wants to take control of them for their own\\nadvantage.\\n\\nCurrent research has used a variety of methods to detect\\nbotnets such as honeypots, IDSs, and machine learning [157].\\nHoneypots act as decoy nodes on a network for attackers\\nto target and defense frameworks have been developed that\\nuse them [158]–[160]. When attackers target this device, this\\nallows for the network operators to gain information of the\\nsize of strength of the botnet without exposing the legitimate\\nnetwork nodes [161]. Other research has developed methods\\nthat use detect botnet C&C server bots by using Domain Name\\nSystem (DNS) queries [162]–[164]. The botnet C&C servers\\nare typically Dynamic DNS (DDNS) providers. Futhermore,\\nresearchers have created IDSs to detect botnets [165]–[167].\\nWith the correct modifications,\\nthese techniques could be\\nutilized in SD-SG defense frameworks.\\n\\n3) Controller Impersonation Attacks: Controller Imperson-\\nation attacks involve an attacker transmitting false signals to\\na device or network in order to mimic a legitimate controller\\n[168], [169]. As a result, the intruder can gain access to and\\nauthority within an SDN network without authorization. In\\n\\nFig. 15. Botnet Life Cycle presented in [157]\\n\\norder to gain access to sensitive information, alter network\\ntraffic, or carry out other attacks, an attacker may pose as\\na controller and send false signals to SDN-enabled network\\nrouters or switches. To address this issue, researchers have\\nproposed authentication models to legitimate controller traffic\\n[168] or have proposed using IDSs and ML algorithms to\\ndetect these attacks [170]. Controller impersonation attacks\\nnecessitate further research efforts in SD-SG network security\\nbecause an imposter controller can destabilize the network\\ntopology and, as a result, the power grid layer itself.\\n\\n4) Black Hole Attacks: A black hole attack is a cyberattack\\nthat happens when a malicious node, such as an SDN-enabled\\nrouter or switch, drops, or ’swallows’, every packet it receives,\\ncausing a ”black hole” in the network [171], [172]. Black hole\\nattacks are one of the most devastating attacks in wireless\\nsensor networks (WSN) [173]. WSN networks have been\\ndeveloped and proposed in the current SG paradigm [18]. It is\\npossible that an attacker will take possession of these nodes to\\nmake it behave this way. Additionally, the attacker can escalate\\nthis attack by seizing control of a controller and forcing nearby\\nswitches to direct network messages to the black hole in order\\nto be dropped by modifying the flow tables of the forwarding\\ndevices.\\n\\nResearch has proposed a variety of methods for detection\\nof black hole attacks such as IDs [174], [175], Clustering\\n[176], [177], Cryptography [178], [179], or Trust-based voting\\nschemes [180], [181]. These methods are intended to mitigate,\\ndetect, and/or prevent these techniques. Although black hole\\nattacks are more common in wireless networks than in wired\\nnetworks, SD-SG can use both wired and wireless connections.\\nAs a result, it is critical that security for these attacks be\\ndeveloped because a black hole attack can result in data loss\\nand QoS disruption.\\n\\nB. Final Thoughts: Unsolved Challenges\\n\\nFuture SD-SG network security research should concentrate\\non the development of defenses against the attacks afore-\\nmentioned. Other SDN applications and research disciplines,\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\x0csuch as localized SDN networks, mobile ad hoc networks\\n(MANETs), and software-defined data centers (SDDCs), have\\ndeveloped security frameworks to combat these attacks. How-\\never, substantial research and ongoing investigation are defi-\\ncient in these areas of SD-SG research, which could result\\nin immense harm. If these vulnerabilities are identified in SD-\\nSG’s security, cybercriminals could use them to disrupt SD-SG\\nusers’ QoS. In order to defend the grid from these cyberat-\\ntacks, SD-SG-specific defense strategies must be developed.\\n\\nVI. CONCLUSION\\n\\nRising electricity consumption, deteriorating infrastructure,\\nand reliability concerns have led to the replacement of tra-\\nditional power grids with SGs. Current SG systems, on\\nthe other hand, necessitate time-consuming manual network\\nmanagement and may encounter interoperability issues due\\nto hardware and software from various vendors. In order\\nto address these concerns, software defined networks (SDN)\\nhave been utilized as a method of monitoring and controlling\\nSG communication networks, resulting in software defined\\nSGs (SD-SG) which has improved network administration,\\nvisibility, control, and security. However, SD-SG remain vul-\\nnerable to cyberattacks that could disrupt power infrastructure\\noperations. As a result, defense and security against these\\nattacks are constantly evolving, necessitating an up-to-date,\\ncomprehensive study analyzing these various cyberattacks and\\ndefense methods proposed in literature. In this study, we filled\\nthis gap for the first time. We characterized and classified\\ncurrent SD-SG network security research efforts, as well as to\\nidentify future research needs and open unsolved challenges\\nin SD-SG network security for future research directions.\\n\\n'"

      "In 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported\n",
      "that 32% of the world’s mortality is related to cardiovascular\n",
      "diseases (CVDs) [1]. In 2020, CVDs were the leading cause of\n",
      "death in the United States, surpassing cancer and COVID-19\n",
      "[2]. Strokes and heart attacks are the leading causes of CVD-\n",
      "related mortalities [1]. Hypertension is the most significant\n",
      "risk factor for CVDs; because it rarely shows early symptoms\n",
      "before causing severe damage to organs such as the heart,\n",
      "blood vessels, brain, eyes, and kidneys. Therefore, it is known\n",
      "as the “silent killer” [3], [4]. Monitoring the blood pressure\n",
      "(BP) is one of the effective and widely accessible methods\n",
      "for diagnosing and reducing CVD prevalence [5]. Abnormal\n",
      "BP is even more critical and life endangering for vulnerable\n",
      "populations, including the elderly and pregnant women.\n",

      "4) Black Hole Attacks: A black hole attack is a cyberattack\n",
      "that happens when a malicious node, such as an SDN-enabled\n",

      "the outdated and inefficient traditional power grids, which\n",
      "suffers from frequent power outages, SGs uses a variety of\n",
      "technologies, such as sensors, analytic, and control systems,\n",

      "SG provides greater transparency and accessibility to energy\n",

      "their energy consumption in real-time [2]. They also allow\n",
      "utility companies to communicate with customers more effi-\n",
      "ciently, providing real-time feedback on energy consumption\n",
      "and assisting customers in making informed decisions about\n",

      "energy usage [3]. These features are due to a high-level\n",

      "forwarding device has very little information about the global\n",
      "state of the network. SDN controllers, on the other hand,\n",
      "have information about network topology, traffic flows, and\n",
      "switch load [119]. The controller sees the entire network and\n",

Two-way communication, demand-side administra-\n<br/>tion, and real-time pricing make smart grids (SGs) dependent\n<br/>on its communication system. Manual network administration\n<br/>slows down SG communication. SG networks additionally utilize\n<br/>hardware and software from several vendors, allowing devices\n<br/>to communicate. Software-defined SGs (SD-SG) use software-\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Medi; font-size:8px\">defined networking (SDN) to monitor and regulate SG global\n<br/>communication networks to address these concerns. SDN sepa-\n<br/>rates the data plane (routers and switches) from the control plane\n<br/>(routing logic) and centralizes control into the SDN controller.\n<br/>This helps network operators manage visibility, control, and\n<br/>security. These benefits have made SDN popular in SG architec-\n<br/>tural and security studies. But because SD-SGs are vulnerable\n<br/>to cyberattacks, there are concerns about the security of these\n<br/>SD-SG networks. Cybercriminals can attack software-defined\n<br/>communication networks, affecting the power grid. Unauthorized\n<br/>access can be used to intercept messages and introduce false\n<br/>data into system measurements, flood communication channels\n<br/>with fraudulent data packets, or target controllers, a potential\n<br/>single point of failure, to cripple SDN networks. Current research\n<br/>reflects this paradigm as defense and security against such attacks\n<br/>have developed and evolved. There is a need for a current study\n<br/>that provides a more detailed analysis and description of SD-SG\n<br/>network security dangers and countermeasures, as well as future\n<br/>research needs and developing threats for the sector. To fill this\n<br/>void, this survey is presented.\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:58px; top:524px; width:241px; height:8px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-MediItal; font-size:8px\">Index Terms</span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Medi; font-size:8px\">—smart grid, software-defined networking, net-\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:48px; top:534px; width:110px; height:8px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Medi; font-size:8px\">work security, cybersecurity\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:135px; top:560px; width:77px; height:9px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">I.

Unlike\n<br/>the outdated and inefficient traditional power grids, which\n<br/>suffers from frequent power outages, SGs uses a variety of\n<br/>technologies, such as sensors, analytic, and control systems,\n<br/>to more effectively monitor and manage energy consumption,\n<br/>generation, and distribution [1]. SG can monitor energy de-\n<br/>mand and supply in real-time, making them more adaptable\n<br/>to changing energy needs.\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:48px; top:698px; width:251px; height:69px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">SG provides greater transparency and accessibility to energy\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">providers, allowing them to effectively monitor and manage\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">their energy consumption in real-time [2]. They also allow\n<br/>utility companies to communicate with customers more effi-\n<br/>ciently, providing real-time feedback on energy consumption\n<br/>and assisting customers in making informed decisions about\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:311px; top:244px; width:251px; height:105px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">energy usage [3]. These features are due to a high-level\n<br/>interdependence between the power grid level and the net-\n<br/>working level of SG architectures [4]–[6]. However, high-level\n<br/>of interdependency is also demonstrated during cyberattack\n<br/>scenarios as an attack in the networking layer can alter the\n<br/>behavior in the power grid layer as well [4]. Thus, network\n<br/>security is a critical component of SG and they become more\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">vulnerable to cyberattacks as they become more interconnected\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">and reliant on communication networks [7], [8].\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:311px; top:352px; width:251px; height:213px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">Cyberattacks could have severe consequences, ranging from\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">power outages for customers and millions of dollars of\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">damages for providers [9]. In addition, SG need continuous\n<br/>monitoring and control and necessitates a network that can\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">handle large amounts of data quickly and reliably, while\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">also ensuring that data is delivered to the correct location\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">the\n<br/>and on time [10]. As the SG infrastructure expands,\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">network’s complexity grows, necessitating more sophisticated\n<br/>management tools and expertise to ensure optimal network\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">performance and security [11]. The network must be able to\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">handle varying energy demand and supply, which can change\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">quickly and necessitate real-time network adjustments, and\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">ongoing management\n<br/>to ensure the safe, dependable, and\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">efficient delivery of energy to consumers.

SDN separates the control and data planes while\n<br/>integrating the control plane into the controller. This allows\n<br/>for greater flexibility and scalability in network infrastruc-\n<br/>ture management [13]. Software-defined networking (SDN)\n<br/>research has shown rapid improvements and discoveries since\n<br/>its public launch in 2009. Compared to traditional networks,\n<br/>SDN has better utilization, efficiency of resources, flexibility\n<br/>of network services, and reduced cost of maintenance [14].\n<br/>Managing the complex infrastructure of a SG can be a\n<br/>daunting task with traditional networking, requiring significant\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">manual intervention and human resources [1]. As shown in\n<br/>Figure 1, SDN simplifies this process by providing a central-\n<br/>ized software controller that manages and configures network\n<br/>devices and protocols, automating many of the tasks involved\n<br/></span></div><span style=\"font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:5px\">\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><span style=\"position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:892px; width:612px; height:792px;\"></span>\n<div style=\"position:absolute; top:892px;\"><a name=\"2\">Page 2</a></div>\n<div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:259px; top:1441px; width:92px; height:7px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:7px\">Fig. 1.

The adoption of SDN with SG\n<br/>have created software defined SG (SD-SG) which experience\n<br/>improved network security, visibility and control by enabling\n<br/>real-time monitoring and analytics, allowing for proactive\n<br/>identification and resolution of network issues [15]. This level\n<br/>of visibility and control is critical in managing the dynamic\n<br/>and complex infrastructure of a SG, where energy source\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">availability can change rapidly.\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:48px; top:1576px; width:251px; height:33px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">Although SDN can provide security response solutions, SD-\n<br/>SG are susceptible to cyberattacks such as distributed denial\n<br/>of service (DDoS), unauthorized access, false data injection,\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:311px; top:1472px; width:251px; height:129px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">etc [4]. Furthermore, the introduction of SDN introduces the\n<br/>SD-SG to additional attacks that target specific elements of\n<br/>the SDN network such as the controller. Current research is\n<br/>disjointed and focuses on development of security frameworks\n<br/>that protect these SD-SG from these attacks by leveraging the\n<br/>features of SDN. There is a need for a review that centralizes,\n<br/>summarizes, and analyzes these approaches for the develop-\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">ment of future efforts.

Table III summarizes related literature for both SG and\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">SD-SG security. This paper concentrates primarily on SD-\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">SG network security and persistent threats, therefore related\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">work that focuses on SG security in general, as seen in the\n<br/>table, is outside its scope. Furthermore, in this paper, we\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">focus mainly on related literature published within the last five\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">years of the paper’s publication date to ensure that we survey\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">the most recent, novel literature and solutions. This section\n<br/>provides a review of related literature and surveys of SD-SG\n<br/>and highlights their missing components which are found in\n<br/>this survey.\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:48px; top:2311px; width:251px; height:141px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">Rehmani et al.

How-\n<br/>ever, the paper’s security section mentioned within the paper\n<br/>only provides a brief overview of the security of SD-SG, and\n<br/>the security papers covered are now outdated. Furthermore,\n<br/>it does not provide an in-depth discussion of future research\n<br/>efforts for SD-SG security threats as mentioned in this paper.\n<br/>Ibdah et al. [16] discuss the vulnerabilities of using SDN\n<br/>in SG systems. The authors start by outlining the architecture\n<br/>of SDN-based SG systems as well as the security risks asso-\n<br/>ciated with this technology. The paper then proposes a five-\n<br/>component security framework for SDN-based SG systems:\n<br/>secure communication, secure data storage, secure compu-\n<br/>tation, secure authentication, and secure access control. The\n<br/>authors go into detail about each of these components and how\n<br/>they can be used in an SDN-based SG system. The authors use\n<br/>the Mininet network emulator to simulate the effectiveness of\n<br/>their proposed security framework. The simulation shows that\n<br/>the proposed framework is effective at mitigating various types\n<br/>of security attacks, such as DoS attacks, data tampering, and\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">unauthorized access. Although the authors provide discussion\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">of security of SD-SG systems, the discussion is very brief and\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">focuses on DDoS attacks and proposal of their framework. The\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">researchers do not provide a comprehensive review of SD-SG\n<br/>security like this survey.\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:311px; top:2072px; width:251px; height:249px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">Akkaya et al.

The researchers investigate the relevant security aspects\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">for each deployment scenario as they progress. However,\n<br/>the researchers only provide discussion of anomaly/intrusion\n<br/>attack detection and only provide breif discussion of controller\n<br/>attacks.

The paper proposes an SDN-based security\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">framework for SG systems that consists of three elements:\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">network visibility, policy enforcement, and threat detection\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">and response.

The authors begin by outlining SG infrastructure\n<br/>and the role of information and communication technologies\n<br/>(ICT) in enabling advanced functionalities like demand re-\n<br/>sponse, distribution automation, and advanced metering. The\n<br/>paper provides discussion about the difficulties that traditional\n<br/>SG infrastructures face, such as a lack of interoperability\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">and flexibility. The paper proposes using SDN to address\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">the challenges that traditional SG infrastructures face while\n<br/>also enabling advanced functionalities. The authors describe\n<br/>the different components of an SDN-enabled SG architecture,\n<br/>such as the SDN controller, network infrastructure, and ap-\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:311px; top:2779px; width:251px; height:93px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">plications. The authors review the potential advantages of an\n<br/>SDN-enabled SG infrastructure, such as increased reliability,\n<br/>security, and energy efficiency. They highlight a number of\n<br/>use cases in which SDN can enable advanced functionality\n<br/>such as dynamic load balancing and network slicing. However,\n<br/>this paper avoids discussing DDoS and controller attacks and\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">only briefly discusses anonymity/intrusion attacks and defense\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">techniques, all topics covered within this survey.\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:397px; top:2881px; width:80px; height:9px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">III.

SDN simply refers to the\n<br/>network architecture whereas the data plane and control plane\n<br/>are decoupled from one another. SDN has the following\n<br/>characteristics [13]:\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:58px; top:4078px; width:241px; height:9px;\"><span style=\"font-family: CMSY7; font-size:6px\">• </span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">Control plane and data plane are separated from one\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:68px; top:4090px; width:31px; height:9px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">another.\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:58px; top:4102px; width:241px; height:33px;\"><span style=\"font-family: CMSY7; font-size:6px\">• </span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">Forwarding decisions are based on flow and not destina-\n<br/>tion.

There have been numerous stepping\n<br/>stones before the eventual creation of SDN technology as we\n<br/>know it today. The General Switch Management protocol in\n<br/>1996, the Tempest (framework for programmable networks)\n<br/>in 1998, and most recently, Ethane and OpenFlow, in 2007\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">and 2008 respectively, were necessary to make modern SDN\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">a reality.

As seen in fig. 3 and\n<br/>the control plane and data plane are\n<br/>discussed in [117],\n<br/>connected in the traditional network architecture while in\n<br/>SDN the control and data plane are in a different stack. In\n<br/>SDN, the control plane bears the responsibility to configure\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">the nodes and defined the paths for the data flows. Once the\n<br/>paths are determined, the controller then gives this information\n<br/>to the data plane. However, in traditional networks, the flow\n<br/>management, or flow policy, is defined by the forwarding\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:303px; top:5009px; width:4px; height:9px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">6\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:311px; top:4538px; width:251px; height:81px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">devices.

The devices act as simply forwarding devices and\n<br/>receive instructions on how to route traffic from the SDN\n<br/>controller. This moves the intelligence of the network from\n<br/>the data plane devices to the controller. Furthermore, these\n<br/>networks contain communication protocols and APIs (i.e.\n<br/>OpenFlow) to ensure the right configurations of the network.\n<br/>This allows the SDN controller immense control and the\n<br/>ability to make adaptive changes to the network in response\n<br/>to the demands of the network operator.\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:48px; top:5272px; width:251px; height:177px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">A data plane device is a hardware or software device that\n<br/>forwards packets through the network. An OpenFlow device\n<br/>utilizes flow tables to direct traffic. The data in these flow\n<br/>tables are a matching rule, actions to be executed on packets\n<br/>that match these rules, and counters to keep statistics of how\n<br/>many packets match these rules. These flow tables define what\n<br/>will happen to packets received to these forwarding devices.\n<br/>When a new packet arrives at the forwarding device, the device\n<br/>checks its flow table to see if there are established instructions\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">on how to properly handle the packet. If there are no flow, or\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">instructions, in the flow table, the forwarding device will send\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">the packet to the controller using the OpenFlow protocol for it\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">to determine what should be done with it. The controller will\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">inspect the packet and determine the appropriate forwarding\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">action.\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:48px; top:5459px; width:115px; height:9px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-ReguItal; font-size:9px\">E.

Controllers allow\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">for the user to control the flow of packets throughout the\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">network by creating or deactivating links between nodes. The\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">controllers gather information from the equipment on the\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">health of the network. It allows for ease of network manage-\n<br/>ment by providing a central point of control for the network.\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">The controller allows the network management with high-level\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">abstraction and APIs to developers. The controller can provide\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">information such as network topology, flow statistics, and\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">device discovery. While using an SDN controller, a developer\n<br/>does not need to be concerned with low-level details of data\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">distribution amongst forwarding devices.\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:48px; top:5631px; width:251px; height:45px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">Many projects have been launched to construct controllers\n<br/>due to the usability and importance of controllers for the\n<br/>SDN control plane. SDN controllers can be separated into two\n<br/>categories centralized vs decentralized [107] [119].\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:48px; top:5678px; width:251px; height:141px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-ReguItal; font-size:9px\">1) Centralized: </span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">Centralized controllers were the first con-\n<br/>trollers to arise with the first version being NOX [120]. NOX\n<br/>was released in 2008 and was the first OpenFlow controller.\n<br/>Having a centralized controller provides numerous benefits\n<br/>compared to traditional networks. In traditional networks, each\n<br/>forwarding device has very little information about the global\n<br/>state of the network. SDN controllers, on the other hand,\n<br/>have information about network topology, traffic flows, and\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">switch load [119]. The controller sees the entire network and\n<br/>is able to quickly deploy to manage or change any area of it.\n<br/>It can also route optimal paths through the network since it\n<br/>has a global view of the routing paths. In traditional networks,\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:311px; top:5153px; width:251px; height:117px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">devices must be added to do certain tasks such as firewalls,\n<br/>intrusion detection, load balancing, etc., but in SDN, all of\n<br/>these tasks can be done by implementing an application in\n<br/>the application layer [119] [121]. These effectively remove\n<br/>the need for these devices and reduce the cost and ease\n<br/>of implementation needed to run the network under desired\n<br/>constraints. In addition, a central controller makes it easy for a\n<br/>developer to apply an application to the entire network through\n<br/>one singular controller instead of having to communicate to\n<br/>multiple controllers in a distributed architecture.\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:311px; top:5272px; width:251px; height:165px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">Although there are multiple advantages of using a cen-\n<br/>tralized controller for an SDN topology,\n<br/>there are certain\n<br/>limitations and disadvantages as well. For a large wide area\n<br/>network (WAN), using a single SDN controller may not be\n<br/>sufficient to properly maintain the network. The network will\n<br/>experience high control latency and bandwidth issues since one\n<br/>controller has to respond to multiple nodes over a large area\n<br/>[119]. Furthermore, as the number of nodes increases in an\n<br/>SDN topology, these nodes will all need to communicate reg-\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">ularly with the controller. This increased number of dynamic\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">communication, in short, the substantial bursts can overload\n<br/>a single controller. Therefore, to handle the load of a WAN,\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">it is beneficial to design a distributed approach and add more\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">controllers to the network.\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:377px; top:5610px; width:120px; height:7px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:7px\">Fig. 4.

The distributed\n<br/>controller SDN structure enables the control plane to respond\n<br/>to various locations in the network in an efficient manner. It\n<br/>enables more dynamic network control and maintenance. Fur-\n<br/>thermore, the distributed controller’s scalability and flexibility\n<br/>make it perfect for WAN.\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:321px; top:5750px; width:217px; height:9px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">However, decentralized topologies are not without\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:311px; top:5750px; width:251px; height:69px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">their\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">challenges.

The two distributed topologies shown are\n<br/>hierarchical and flat models. In the hierarchical model, the\n<br/>root controller has global knowledge of the network and is\n<br/>in charge of the local controllers. The local controllers do\n<br/>not communicate with each other in the hierarchical model.\n<br/>On the other hand, the flat model does not contain any root\n<br/>controller and relies heavily on East/West API communication\n<br/>to share with each other the global state of the network. In both\n<br/>networks, there is a degree of difficulty that is increased when\n<br/>there are multiple controllers that need to communicate with\n<br/>one another. In the hierarchical model, the root controllers\n<br/>provide a single point of failure. In the flat model, challenges\n<br/>arise with the need for regular communication needed between\n<br/>controllers to update the global state of the network [119],\n<br/>[124].\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:48px; top:6175px; width:251px; height:117px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">East and westbound are essential in distributed SDN topolo-\n<br/>gies.

However, it does not need a centralized controller and\n<br/>the control plane is updated using third-party firmware on the\n<br/>devices.

[85] propose a game-\n<br/>theoretic approach to improving data privacy in SD-SG, with\n<br/>the goal of reducing passive information leakage through\n<br/>compromised controllers. The proposed privacy framework is\n<br/>based on the formulation of a noncooperative game among\n<br/>the switches. The requirements for privacy are quantified using\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">information theory mutual information and differential privacy.\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">An iterative best response algorithm is used to compute\n<br/>the game’s Nash equilibrium [138].

[86] suggest a Software-Defined Controller\n<br/>Placement Camouflage (SD-CPC), a stochastic game-based\n<br/>MTD method for improving SDN controller resilience against\n<br/>cyber threats. Figure 9 shows a model of a game-based MTD.\n<br/>The technique seeks to make SDN controllers less vulnerable\n<br/>to attackers by dynamically relocating virtualized controllers\n<br/>and changing their IP addresses. There are two participants in\n<br/>the game: player 1 is the system defender, and player 2 is the\n<br/>attacker. The attacker targeted the most vulnerable regions of\n<br/>the network in their simulations, while the system defender\n<br/>location to migrate the controllers in\n<br/>determined the best\n<br/>reaction. The technique performed particularly well against\n<br/>attacks that tried to exploit vulnerabilities in the controller’s\n<br/>software or targeted the controller’s location.

[87] proposes a Mov-\n<br/>ing Target Defense (MTD) approach based on virtual security\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">functions (VSF) (e.g. firewalls, IDS, traffic classifier, etc.) to\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">improve the security of SDN networks in SG. Furthermore, re-\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">searchers suggest mitigrating the VSF to resource-rich servers\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">will help mitigate the effects on the VSF. The approach aims\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">to defend against controller attacks by proposing a moving\n<br/>target defense of SD-SG based on a proposed security function\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">virtualization (SFV), making it difficult for attackers to locate\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">and exploit vulnerabilities. The authors used a simulation\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">of a real-world SG topology to assess the effectiveness of\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">the proposed approach. According to the findings, SFV-based\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">MTD can reduce the success rate of various attacks. The\n<br/>method worked especially well against attacks that targeted\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">the controller’s location or attempted to exploit vulnerabilities\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">in the controller’s software. Their proposed algorithm achieves\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">the maximum available resource increment, whereas other\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">popular algorithms, random and greedy algorithms, achieve\n<br/>lesser performance.

MystifY had a negligible impact on system perfor-\n<br/>mance. Finally, the proposed approach, MystifY, provides an\n<br/>effective and efficient proactive MTD solution for improving\n<br/>the SD-CPS’s resilience to advanced persistent threats. The\n<br/>approach achieves a high level of security while having little\n<br/>impact on system performance.\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:311px; top:9494px; width:251px; height:165px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-ReguItal; font-size:9px\">3) Final Thoughts for Controller Attack Defense: </span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">Con-\n<br/>trollers, which manage the network and send flows to forward-\n<br/>ing devices, are an essential component of SDN frameworks.\n<br/>To prevent cyber attacks, SD-SG network operators must\n<br/>devise methods to secure controllers. To improve the re-\n<br/>silience of SDN networks against advanced persistent threats,\n<br/>several moving target defense (MTD) approaches, such as\n<br/>game-theoretic and stochastic game-based methods, have been\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">proposed. MTD approaches involve regularly changing the\n<br/>controller’s network addresses and/or ports to make it difficult\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">for attackers to track its location and exploit vulnerabilities.\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">By moving VSF to resource-rich servers, MTD approaches\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">based on virtual security functions (VSF) can also mitigate\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">the effects of attacks.\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:311px; top:9670px; width:114px; height:9px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-ReguItal; font-size:9px\">C. Intrusion Attack Defense\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:311px; top:9685px; width:251px; height:344px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">In the ideal scenario, the SD-SG is expected to be ac-\n<br/>cessed through authorized entities to meet the three main\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">cyber-security goals of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">availability. However, SD-SG vulnerabilities occur as a result\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">of unauthorized access due to intrusion attacks such as false\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">data injection, ARP spoofing, DoS, and host location attacks\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">[1]. For this reason, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are\n<br/>solutions that detect and report\n<br/>these attacks. Figure 10\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">illustrates the integration of IDS as an application residing\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">in the SDN architecture. The SDN controller receives flow\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">statistics from the OpenFlow switch and sends them to the\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">IDS, which uses a data processing technique for anomaly\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">detection. The generated report on the traffic flow statistics\n<br/>is sent from the IDS to the SDN controller, which updates\n<br/>the flow rule in the switch to either drop or forward packets\n<br/>based on the received report. IDS can also reside either in\n<br/>the controller or hypervisor and this has been demonstrated\n<br/>in [93], [96]. IDS as shown in figure 11 is mainly classified\n<br/>as Host IDS (HIDS) and Network IDS (NIDS). HIDS runs\n<br/>on a network device to observe the behavior of other network\n<br/>devices while the NIDS analyzes network traffic [140]. NIDS\n<br/>contributes to analyzing SDN traffic flow to identify intrusion\n<br/>attacks. Hence, this section focuses on the proposed detection\n<br/>techniques in NIDS. Based on how data is processed for attack\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">detection, IDS can be further categorized as Signature-based\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">and Anomaly-based.

The authors implement the\n<br/>Snort IDS, which uses known rule-based signatures to detect\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">intrusion attacks namely DDoS, DDoS with IP spoofing, and\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">DDoS with IP packet size manipulation. The proposed method\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">operates in three phases which are the detection, communi-\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">cation, and mitigation phases. The Snort IDS detects DDoS\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">attacks in the detection phase and alerts the SDN controller\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">the detected intrusion attack in the communication\n<br/>about\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">phase. In the mitigation phase, the SDN controller installs\n<br/>some flow rules in the switch to block the intrusion attack.\n<br/>The experimental results indicate that implementing the Snort\n<br/>IDS based on the SDN paradigm mitigates DDoS attacks while\n<br/>maintaining the normal operation of a network. However, the\n<br/>authors used a single Ryu controller which makes the entire\n<br/>network susceptible to a single point of failure. Moreover,\n<br/>the Snort IDS is a Signature-based IDS that detects known\n<br/>intrusion attacks correctly but has a high false alarm rate\n<br/>in identifying unknown intrusion attacks and mutations in\n<br/>known attacks.

A high entropy implies scattering\n<br/>of the feature distribution whereas a low entropy indicates\n<br/>convergence of the feature distribution.

At the University of Florida, we have\n<br/>developed ML algorithms and cross-layered strategies to detect\n<br/>these attacks with greater performance than other state-of-the-\n<br/>art methods. In addition, we have developed and proposed\n<br/>novel D3-SDN for SD-SG communication layer to mitigate\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">risk to cyberattacks.\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:113px; top:14662px; width:122px; height:9px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">V.

One challenge is resiliency, which is defined as\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">how quickly a network can recover victimized nodes and\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">restore connectivity to end users in the event of a cyberattack.\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">DoS attacks pose a significant risk to the resilience of these\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">networks. As previously stated, these kinds of attacks can be\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">conducted to flood target nodes or components in the SD-SG\n<br/>in order to harm or fully shut them down. As stated in Sec-\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">tion IV-A, various solutions against DDoS/DoS attacks have\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">been proposed, including blockchain, machine learning, SDN\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">properties, and moving target defenses. Blockchain approaches\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">can increase network security by validating network traffic\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">and the behavior of nodes. However, they require recording,\n<br/>storing, and validating the blockchain process which can add\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">overhead and strain to the system. A lightweight blockchain\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">architecture capable of protecting an SD-SG from DDoS/DoS\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">attacks and providing recovery of nodes has yet to be created.\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">ML models can be taught to detect DDoS/DoS threats, but they\n<br/>fail when it comes to detecting DDoS/DoS attacks launched\n<br/>using zero-day exploits or techniques that the model has yet\n<br/>to be trained and tested on. As a result, trained ML solutions\n<br/>need to be consistently updated with the latest data available\n<br/>which may not be feasible. In addition, a robust ML model\n<br/>that can detect novel DDoS/DoS attacks and provide recovery\n<br/>solutions for victimized nodes remains to be observed. Other\n<br/>research has focused on using SDN properties such as utilizing\n<br/>the controller’s global view of the network to provide detection\n<br/>and mitigation for smurf attacks, sock stress attacks, and SYN\n<br/>flood attacks by employing lightweight Tsallis entropy-based\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">defense mechanisms. Although these tactics are effective for\n<br/>detecting and mitigating these attacks, they do not recover\n<br/>nodes that have gone down because of DDoS/DoS attacks or\n<br/>hijacked nodes used to launch DDoS/DoS attacks. Instead,\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:311px; top:14415px; width:251px; height:225px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">it focuses on denying port access for identified attacker\n<br/>nodes, which unavoidably causes certain nodes to become\n<br/>unavailable, allowing the DDoS/DoS attack to succeed. The\n<br/>demand for a controller centralization technique capable of\n<br/>recovering fallen nodes remains unfulfilled. Other strategies\n<br/>have used moving target defensive techniques that focus\n<br/>on randomizing link pathways to make DDoS/DoS attacks\n<br/>successful. Although the links are allowed to change on a\n<br/>regular basis, making it more difficult for the attacker to\n<br/>launch a DoS attack, continually changing network topology\n<br/>may result in increased overhead and strain on the controller,\n<br/>lowering overall network performance. A strategy that allows\n<br/>for moving target defense while also providing node recovery\n<br/>has yet to be developed. In summary, these tactics largely focus\n<br/>on detection, prevention, and mitigation rather than recovery\n<br/>of downed nodes, making the DDoS/DoS attack’s ultimate\n<br/>purpose effective. The unsolved task of recovering fallen nodes\n<br/>and regaining those nodes with minimal overhead and strain\n<br/>on the SD-SG network infrastructure remains.\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:311px; top:14642px; width:251px; height:440px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">The capacity to protect the privacy of data shared within\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">the SD-SG presents an additional challenge. The privacy\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">risk of these networks is significantly increased by controller\n<br/>attacks. As previously stated, such attacks can be leveraged\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">to take unauthorized control of the SDN controller, which\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">has entire network authority. The SDN controller can be used\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">by attackers to monitor data transmission and, if necessary,\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">divert traffic to hostile hosts. As mentioned in Section IV-B,\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">a number of defenses against controller attacks have been put\n<br/>forth, including moving-target defense and game theory. With\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">the aid of game theory, developers create games in which\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">the security system (a player) must make several decisions in\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">order to achieve a predetermined objective, such as protecting\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">the controller from an attacker (another player). Although\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">game theory can be used to improve controller security and\n<br/>avoid data leakage to ensure data privacy, its implementation\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">inside a system can result\n<br/>in additional system overhead.\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">Furthermore, a reliable method that can identify both a com-\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">promised controller and the attacker who launched the attack\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">has not yet been developed. If the controller and attacker were\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">identified, more effective and precise security measures may\n<br/>be taken. Other studies have concentrated on moving target\n<br/>defense methods such as changing the controllers’ various\n<br/>ports to confuse attackers or relocating the controller through\n<br/>the use of software. These techniques can continuously alter\n<br/>the topology, which would be a deterrent to attackers, but\n<br/>they would necessitate regular synchronization of routing\n<br/>logic across the network to ensure proper communication\n<br/>delivery due to continuously fluctuating communication links.\n<br/>Furthermore, it has not yet been realized that a moving target\n<br/>defense can recognize a compromised controller and/or the\n<br/>attacker. In conclusion, these strategies primarily aim to stop\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">controller attacks in order to prevent the controller(s) from\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">being compromised and leaking data. However, the unresolved\n<br/>issue of identifying which controller(s) are compromised,\n<br/>as well as the identity of the attacker, remains unresolved.\n<br/>Therefore, mitigation techniques for IDS techniques remain\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:301px; top:15113px; width:9px; height:9px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">18\n<br/></span></div><span style=\"position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:15206px; width:612px; height:792px;\"></span>\n<div style=\"position:absolute; top:15206px;\"><a name=\"19\">Page 19</a></div>\n<div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:48px; top:15257px; width:74px; height:9px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">an unsolved issue.\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:48px; top:15269px; width:251px; height:655px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">It is important for the SD-SG to guarantee reliability in\n<br/>its communication infrastructure by ensuring that very few\n<br/>cyber attacks work with little or no impact using fast recovery\n<br/>mechanisms for sustainable and continuous provisioning of\n<br/>services with no interruptions. However,\n<br/>intrusion attacks,\n<br/>which are launched by intruders through unauthorized access\n<br/>to disrupt the normal operation of the SD-SG make it difficult\n<br/>to provide reliability. Hence, this still remains a major problem\n<br/>in SD-SG, although several literature reviews on counteracting\n<br/>intrusion attacks using IDS have been discussed in Section\n<br/>IV-C. From the discussions, the Signature-based IDS using\n<br/>rule-based methods are efficient in detecting known DDoS\n<br/>intrusion attacks with low response time complexities but are\n<br/>inefficient in detecting new or mutating forms of intrusion\n<br/>attacks. To combat this problem, ML and DL solutions have\n<br/>been explored and applied in IDSs. The Machine learning\n<br/>and Deep learning IDS based on a single model have poor\n<br/>generalization for complex intrusion attack detection. Most\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">research done to resolve this problem involves combining\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">two or more ML and/or DL models, and this has proven to\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">be very effective in detecting intrusion attacks. However, the\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">unavailability and unbalance of real-world datasets strongly\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">influence the performance of ML and/or DL IDS solutions.\n<br/>Moreover, the availability of these datasets and their direct\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">exposure to the wrong hands of malicious users can breach\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">the privacy of these sensitive data and introduce more complex\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">intrusion attacks. To tackle this problem for the performance\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">improvement of ML and/or DL-based IDS to ensure a reliable\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">SD-SG, there is the need to explore more mechanisms that\n<br/>reduce the constraints with training data availability or imbal-\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">ance, and these methods include transfer learning, federated\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">learning, and data augmentation. The communication network\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">traffic has dynamic patterns, which could be associated with\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">instances such as a change in the network topology or users’\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">service demands. Subsequently, the data training phase of ML\n<br/>and/or DL-based IDS continually has to update its dataset\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">for training to adapt to the dynamic network traffic. Utilizing\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">advanced online training algorithms and automated updates\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">of the ML and/or DL-based IDS depending on the network\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">traffic pattern remains an important research area that can\n<br/>be explored to provide reliability in SD-SG. The reviewed\n<br/>research mostly considers a single SDN controller for updating\n<br/>flow rules, and intrusion attacks on this controller cause single\n<br/>point of failure vulnerabilities resulting in a total shutdown\n<br/>of the communication network. On the other hand, other\n<br/>research works utilize multiple controllers to overcome this\n<br/>issue to ensure fast failovers to sustain normal operations.\n<br/>Although the use of more than one SDN controller improves\n<br/>the reliability of the SD-SG, it presents open research areas\n<br/>such as reducing SDN control overheads, optimally placing\n<br/>and allocating resources to SDN controllers, synchronizing\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">the network states among SDN controllers, and selecting a\n<br/>cluster head from a cluster of SDN controllers. An underlying\n<br/>unsolved problem is that the discussed literature focuses more\n<br/>on intrusion attack detection and further work is required on\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:311px; top:15257px; width:251px; height:33px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">not only detecting complex intrusion attacks but mitigating\n<br/>these attacks within an optimal time for reliability in the time-\n<br/>critical SD-SGs.\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:311px; top:15293px; width:251px; height:368px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">As researchers continue to develop unique models and\n<br/>methods to defend SD-SG against attacks, the challenge of\n<br/>adaptability, or defense methods that are not rigidly con-\n<br/>figured, arises. To genuinely provide a holistic defensive\n<br/>approach against attackers, researchers must examine how\n<br/>flexible their solutions are to numerous attack types and\n<br/>scenarios. Unbeknownst to network defenders, attackers can\n<br/>perform a number of cyberattacks against an SD-SG. A\n<br/>significant portion of current research focuses on specialized\n<br/>SD-SG defense strategies for specific attacks. However, as\n<br/>noted in Section IV-D, there is a new area of SD-SG research\n<br/>focusing on the creation of multi-attack defensive solutions\n<br/>that evaluate data from both physical and network SD-SG\n<br/>components. These solutions primarily employ cross-layered\n<br/>machine learning algorithms that combine cross-layered en-\n<br/>semble learning methods with correlation detectors to dynami-\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">cally update the statistical model or parameters based on power\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">flow traffic for improved detection of multiple attacks. Cross-\n<br/>layered machine learning algorithms including CECD-AS and\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">ECD-AS incorporate data from both the power grid and the\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">network layer to detect multiple threats (i.e. DDoS, FDI, and\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">MITM) and react to changes in network state. Although these\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">systems can detect many threats, they are data-driven and must\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">be regularly updated with data from various sources. These\n<br/>strategies necessitate data collection from both the power\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">grid and network layers, which may add overhead to SD-\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">SG operations. Furthermore, the model’s failure to recognize\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">attacks that it has not seen or trained for remains an unresolved\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">issue. Therefore, the unsolved challenge of a robust defense\n<br/>model for a multi-cyberattack solution capable of detecting\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">novel or unforeseen attacks has not yet been realized.\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:311px; top:15671px; width:164px; height:9px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-ReguItal; font-size:9px\">A.

In the next subsections, we examine emerg-\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">ing potential threats to SD-SG network security in the form\n<br/>of cyberattacks that have yet to be researched for SD-SG\n<br/>and provide potential solutions offered for these attacks in\n<br/>other SDN security literature. As shown in Figure 5,\n<br/>the\n<br/>emerging threats to SD-SG network security research are\n<br/>the following: Low Rate Denial-of-Service (LDoS) Attacks,\n<br/>Controller Impersonation Attacks, and Black Hole Attacks.\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:311px; top:15806px; width:251px; height:117px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-ReguItal; font-size:9px\">1) Low Rate Denial-of-Service (LDoS) Attack: </span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">LDoS at-\n<br/>tacks are stealthier version of the violent nature of DDoS\n<br/>attacks [152].

Researchers used the comb filter to filter\n<br/>LDoS attacks from transmission control protocol (TCP) traffic\n<br/>by analyzing the amplitude spectrum to determine periodic\n<br/>parameters of the LDoS attack [153]. Other Researchers have\n<br/>employed using the random early detection (RED) algorithm\n<br/>which is an active queue management (AQM) method de-\n<br/>ployed on the router. The RED algorithm avoids congestion\n<br/>by pre-emptively dropping packets before the router’s bufer\n<br/>becomes full. Research efforts [154], [155] have deployed\n<br/>modified variations of RED and AQM methods on routers\n<br/>to detect LDoS attacks. Other efforts [156] have deployed\n<br/>machine learning models based on Q-learning to dynamically\n<br/>allocate resources as needed.

Bots are malware-infected computers that com-\n<br/>pose the botnet network and can number in the hundreds of\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">thousands. The C&amp;C channel is a server that is responsible\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">for disseminating commands and receiving information for\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">later access by the botmaster. With control of the botnet,\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">the botmaster can initiate cyberattacks, disseminate spam or\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">malware, conduct ransom attacks, steal personal information,\n<br/>etc. and cause millions in damages [157]. A botnet architecture\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">is shown in Figure 15. Additionally, botmasters may offer\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">infected computers to other hackers for use in their own\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">attacks. Because of their crucial role in network governance\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">as aforementioned, SDN controllers are desirable targets for\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">botmasters wants to take control of them for their own\n<br/>advantage.\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:48px; top:16541px; width:251px; height:165px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">Current research has used a variety of methods to detect\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">botnets such as honeypots, IDSs, and machine learning [157].\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">Honeypots act as decoy nodes on a network for attackers\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">to target and defense frameworks have been developed that\n<br/>use them [158]–[160]. When attackers target this device, this\n<br/>allows for the network operators to gain information of the\n<br/>size of strength of the botnet without exposing the legitimate\n<br/>network nodes [161]. Other research has developed methods\n<br/>that use detect botnet C&amp;C server bots by using Domain Name\n<br/>System (DNS) queries [162]–[164]. The botnet C&amp;C servers\n<br/>are typically Dynamic DNS (DDNS) providers. Futhermore,\n<br/>researchers have created IDSs to detect botnets [165]–[167].\n<br/>With the correct modifications,\n<br/>these techniques could be\n<br/>utilized in SD-SG defense frameworks.\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:48px; top:16708px; width:251px; height:58px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-ReguItal; font-size:9px\">3) Controller Impersonation Attacks: </span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">Controller Imperson-\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">ation attacks involve an attacker transmitting false signals to\n<br/>a device or network in order to mimic a legitimate controller\n<br/>[168], [169].

Black hole\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">attacks are one of the most devastating attacks in wireless\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">sensor networks (WSN) [173]. WSN networks have been\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">developed and proposed in the current SG paradigm [18]. It is\n<br/>possible that an attacker will take possession of these nodes to\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">make it behave this way. Additionally, the attacker can escalate\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">this attack by seizing control of a controller and forcing nearby\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">switches to direct network messages to the black hole in order\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">to be dropped by modifying the flow tables of the forwarding\n<br/></span><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">devices.\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:311px; top:16586px; width:251px; height:117px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-Regu; font-size:9px\">Research has proposed a variety of methods for detection\n<br/>of black hole attacks such as IDs [174], [175], Clustering\n<br/>[176], [177], Cryptography [178], [179], or Trust-based voting\n<br/>schemes [180], [181]. These methods are intended to mitigate,\n<br/>detect, and/or prevent these techniques. Although black hole\n<br/>attacks are more common in wireless networks than in wired\n<br/>networks, SD-SG can use both wired and wireless connections.\n<br/>As a result, it is critical that security for these attacks be\n<br/>developed because a black hole attack can result in data loss\n<br/>and QoS disruption.\n<br/></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:311px; top:16715px; width:167px; height:9px;\"><span style=\"font-family: NimbusRomNo9L-ReguItal; font-size:9px\">B.
