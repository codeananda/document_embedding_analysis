It is generally accepted as fact that the condom provides the best protection from venereal disease and HIV virus, aside from complete sexual abstinence. Unfortunately, such a positive barrier device is, at present, the only sure or certain way to prevent transmission of all STD's, many of which cause great personal suffering and, in the cases of AIDS and syphilis, death.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Condoms are generally designed to be applied to the male member, although recent adaptations have been introduced which permit their use by women in the form a liner for the vaginal canal. Such a condom is disclosed in US-A-4805604. However, a significant form of sexual activity, namely oral-genital sexual contact, has not been well served by the forms of condoms known in the prior art. Although many individuals do not openly discuss or acknowledge participating in such practices, many surveys have shown that oral-genital sex is highly desired and engaged in frequently. Commercially available condoms are not designed to facilitate or accommodate oral-genital sex. Moreover, the oral cavity, together with the lips and surrounding skin, provides many opportunities for disease transmission. Brushing and flossing of teeth, biting the cheek or tongue accidentally, or STD lesions in the mouth and throat areas all create breaks in the skin and mucosa that provide direct vectors to the blood. The present invention is directed toward a condom-like prophylactic that protects the oral cavity during oral sexual activity, so that disease transmission is blocked. It also protects the genitals, thus avoiding transmission in either direction. This is a unique solution to a very serious problem.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The typical male condom device may be used to prevent skin-to-skin contact during fellatio, but it suffers from the same drawback for this use as for other uses; i.e., it<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> requires male arousal prior to use, so that the condom may be applied to the male member. If arousal can be achieved only through sensual contact, then the safety desired by the user of the condom may have been abrogated. Moreover, the typical male condom is required to engage the penis in a tight, compressive grip to prevent accidental removal during vaginal sex; this tight fit is undesirable for fellatio and uncomfortable for the fellatee. Examples of such condoms are disclosed in US-A-4872464 and US-A-4888007. These documents disclose a male condom with a shield surrounding the open end of the condom, said shield extending away from the open mouth of the condom.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Furthermore, the condoms known in the prior art are not designed to protect against skin-to-skin contact during cunnilingus. Devices have been invented to protect a person's tongue from contact with unpalatable medicine, as well as other devices such as impervious sheets and garments, but none of these inventions permit the practice of cunnilingus while eliminating the risk of disease transmission through direct contact. This is a major failing of the prior art, especially since many individuals participate in cunnilingus without protection, and such practices can be a major vector of disease transmission. Only one device has been proposed in the prior art that allows the performance of cunnilingus. That is the device disclosed in CA-A-1274352. That device comprises a facial mask which has a stretchable portion over the mouth to allow the extension of a wearers tongue. This device is, however, inelegant and unsatisfactory in use.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">From a commercial standpoint, surveys have shown that nearly 50% of condoms purchased are sold to women, although it is clear that condoms as known in the prior art are predominantly worn by the male. Therefore there is an implication that many women are concerned about contraception and disease prevention, and desirous of taking steps toward prevention of both. Many persons of both sexes may wish to participate in oral sex but hesitate. These "aesthetically fastidious" individuals may now safely and pleasurably benefit themselves and their sex partners, using the present invention. Studies show that only 50% of women achieve orgasm via penile/vaginal sex. One-half require oral or digital manipulation to achieve climax. Indeed, at present a woman who desires to achieve a climax via cunnilingus must do so unprotected. Combined with the facts that many women desire to<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> participate in cunnilingus and fellatio, clearly there is an unfilled need and a large market for condoms which permit the safe practice of oral sex.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It should also be noted that condoms currently available on the market are not designed nor directed toward oral use. The lubricants typically provided in condom packages have odors and tastes that are at best inoffensive, and at worst are completely aversive.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention generally comprises a condom-like prophylactic designed to permit the practice of oral sex while preventing the transmission of venereal and other contagious diseases through oral-genital contact. In one aspect of the invention, there is provided a condom adapted to be worn in the mouth of the person practising oral sex, as described in claim 1.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The condom includes a tubular member having one closed end and formed of thin, pliant, impervious material. Joined to the open end of the tubular member are a pair of flanges extending generally radially outwardly and spaced closely together.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The flanges may be curved out of a plane transverse to the axis of the tubular member to define a channel having the general configuration of the lips and mouth of the average person. The device is gripped by placing the lips within the channel, and closing the jaws slightly to compress and retain the open end of the device. A third flange may be provided, generally parallel to the other flanges, to define a further channel in which the teeth of the user may be engaged.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The tubular member may be formed to extend into the mouth of the wearer, for the purpose of performing fellatio. A penis may be inserted into the tubular member without making direct contact with the lips or mouth or tongue of the wearer. In an alternative form of the invention, the tubular member may extend outwardly from the flanges and the mouth, so that the tongue of the wearer may be extended into the tubular member to perform cunnilingus without making direct contact with the vulva.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The invention also includes an embodiment in which the condom is provided with a progressively expanding diameter from the base to the closed end. The expanded head provides far more comfort and sensation during fellatio.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In all of the embodiments described, the device may be packaged not only with a lubricating substance but also, or alternatively, with a substance that imparts a pleasant scent and taste to the device, adding further sensual pleasure to oral sexual activity. In addition, the pliant material that forms the condom-like prophylactic may be provided with surface texture and colour to enhance enjoyment during use.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><heading id="h0002"><u>Brief Description of the Drawing</u></heading><p id="p0013" num="0013"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>Figure 1 is a perspective view of one embodiment of the condom for oral-genital use of the present invention</li><li>Figure 2 is a fragmentary, partially broken away view of the tubular portion of the embodiment of the invention shown in Figure 1.</li><li>Figure 3 is a side elevation of the embodiment of the invention shown in Figures 1 and 2.</li><li>Figure 4 is an end elevation of the embodiment shown in Figures 1-3.</li><li>Figure 5 is a cross-sectional elevation taken along line 5-5 of Figure 4.</li><li>Figure 6 is a cross-sectional elevation similar to Figure 5, depicting a further development of the embodiment of Figures 1-5.</li><li>Figure 7 is a cross-sectional schematic side view of the average human dentition and oral structure.</li><li>Figure 8 is a cross-sectional view as in Figure 7, showing the use of the embodiment of the condom of the present invention for fellatio.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></li><li>Figure 9 is a cross-sectional view as in Figure 7, showing the use of a further embodiment of the condom of the present invention for cunnilingus.</li><li>Figure 10 is an end view of the condom of the present invention, as in Figure 4, showing an alternative placement in the mouth.</li><li>Figure 11 is a perspective view of another embodiment of the invention, adapted for particular use in cunnilingus.</li><li>Figure 12 is an end view of the embodiment shown in Figure 11.</li><li>Figure 13 is a side elevation of the embodiment shown in Figures 11 and 12.</li><li>Figure 14 is a perspective view of another embodiment of the invention adapted for fellatio.</li><li>Figure 15 is a cross-sectional view as in Figure 7, showing the use of the embodiment of Figure 14 of the present invention for fellatio.</li><li>Figure 16 is a perspective view of another embodiment of the invention adapted for cunnilingus.</li><li>Figure 17 is a cross-sectional view as in Figure 7, showing the use of the embodiment of Figure 16 of the present invention for cunnilingus.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><heading id="h0003"><u>Description of the Preferred Embodiments</u></heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">The present invention generally comprises a condom designed to permit the practice of oral sex while preventing the transmission of venereal and other contagious diseases through oral-genital contact. With reference to Figures 1-5, one embodiment of the invention comprises a condom 31 which includes a tubular portion 32 having a rounded, dosed end 33 and an opposed open end 34. The length of the tubular portion from the closed end 33 to the opening 34 is generally a few inches, and may be shorter than a typical prior art male condom. The tubular member adjacent to the opening 34 is formed with an oval, ellipsoid cross-section, and the opening end 34 describes a smoothly curved arc, with the arc extending in the same direction as the major axis of the ellipsoidal cross-section, as can been observed by comparing Figures 3 and 4. The tubular portion 32 may be provided with an expanded diameter adjacent to the closed end 33 and extending toward the open end, as shown in Figure 2, to establish a non-constrictive fit with the male member.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A significant feature of the condom 31 is the provision of a pair of flanges 36 and 37 disposed adjacent to the open end 34. The flanges 36 and 37 are closely spaced apart, and are defined as toroidal surfaces that are generally parallel. Both flanges are ovoid or elliptical when viewed in an end elevation (Figure 4), and flange 36 is slightly smaller in major and minor axis dimensions. The flanges extend in outwardly flaring fashion toward the dosed end 33, and there is defined between the flanges 36 and 37 a channel 38. The flanges 36 and 37 are each provided with a thickened rim 39 and 41,<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> respectively, extending continuously about the distal edge portion of each flange to impart form-retaining characteristics to the flanges. The rims 39 and 41 maintain the open end of the condom and prevent collapse thereof, and maintain the parallel spacing and disposition of the flanges. In an alternative embodiment shown in Figure 6, the distal edges of the flanges 36 and 37 are provided with a pair of O-Rings 42 and 43, respectively, each incorporated into one of the distal edges of one of the flanges. The O-Rings serve the same purposes as the rims 39 and 41.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The condom 31 may be formed of a pliant, thin, elastic, impervious material such as latex rubber, vinyl, or any similar non-toxic, non-allergenic, non-irritative material by multiple dipping processes, molding processes, or the like. With reference to Figure 2, the majority of the tubular portion 32 is rather thin, on the order of 0.051-0.25 mm (0.002-0.010 inch), whereas the end portion 44 of the tubular member adjacent to the open end 34 is thicker. One satisfactory version has an end portion thickness of 0.76 mm (0.030 inch). The end portion 44, which flares slightly to join the flanges 36 and 37, is subject to the most stress and flexure of the assembly, and the thickness of this portion is increased proportionally.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The embodiments depicted in Figures 1-6 are designed to be used as shown in Figures 7 and 8. Figure 7 shows a schematic cross-sectional elevation of the jaw area of a human head, including the upper jaw and teeth 51, the lower jaw and teeth 52, and the tongue 53 in the mouth 54. The condom 31 is applied to the mouth 54, with the dosed end 33 and tubular portion 32 placed into the mouth. The condom 31 is oriented so that the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> upper and lower lips are engaged in the channel 38, preferably at opposite ends of the major axis of the ellipsoid formed by the opening 34. (Physiological variations may determine that the condom 31 is more easily used when oriented with upper and lower lips aligned with at opposite ends of the minor axis.) The jaws are dosed slightly to squeeze the condom therebetween, deforming the ellipsoid into a more cylindrical shape, or further into a laterally extending ellipsoid, as shown in phantom line in Figure 10.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The flange 37 is disposed outside of the lips of the condom user, and the flange 36 is disposed between the lips and teeth, as shown in Figure 8. The open end 34 of the condom is directed outwardly to receive a penis for performing fellatio, and the length of the condom limits penetration of the penis to prevent triggering of the gag reflex. Furthermore, there is no interference with the nose of the condom user, so that the user may breathe freely. The condom permits fellatio while preventing skin-to-skin contact between the oral surfaces and the genital surfaces. After use, the condom 31 may be removed by grasping the outer flange 37 and pulling it from the mouth 54.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">A further embodiment of the present invention, shown in Figures 11-13, comprises a condom designed to permit the practice of cunnilingus while preventing skin-to-skin contact between oral and genital surfaces. (Throughout the description of the preferred embodiments, common reference numerals applied to different Figures and embodiments refer to the same structures.) The condom 61 includes a tapered, convex tubular portion<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> 62 having a narrow, rounded dosed end 63 and an open end 64. Joined to the tubular portion 62 adjacent to the open end 64 are a pair of flanges 36 and 37, as described previously, with a channel 38 defined therebetween. The flanges 36 and 37 are substantially the same as described previously, in form and function. The tubular portion 62 is formed of a similar material as described above.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">With regard to Figure 9, the condom 61 is employed by being applied to the mouth 54, with the closed end 63 and tubular portion 62 placed outside the mouth. The condom 61 is oriented so that the upper and lower lips are engaged in the channel 38 at opposite ends of the major axis of the ellipsoid formed by the opening 64. The jaws are dosed slightly to squeeze the condom therebetween, deforming the ellipsoid into a more cylindrical shape, or further into a laterally extending ellipsoid, as shown in phantom line in Figure 10. The flange 37 is disposed outside of the lips of the condom user, and the flange 36 is disposed between the lips and teeth, as shown in Figure 9. The tubular portion 62 extends outwardly, providing a sheath for the extended tongue 53 of the user. The condom 61 permits the user to perform cunnilingus while the tongue 53 , lips, and surrounding area of the user are protected from contact with the vulva of the recipient. After use, the condom is removed by manually grasping the outer flange 37 and disengaging the dentition and lips from the flanges and channel 38.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Another embodiment of the invention, depicted in Figure 14, is similar in many aspects to the embodiment of Figures 1 and 3, and common reference numerals are used to designate common features. This embodiment includes a tubular portion 32 having a rounded, dosed end 33 and an opposed open end 34. The length of the tubular portion from the closed end 33 to the opening 34 is generally a few inches, and may be shorter than a typical prior art male condom. The tubular member adjacent to the opening 34 is formed with an oval, ellipsoid cross-section, and the opening end 34 describes a smoothly curved arc, with the arc extending in the same direction as the major axis of the ellipsoidal cross-section. As described previously, a pair of flanges 36 and 37 are disposed adjacent to the open end 34. The flanges 36 and 37 are closely spaced apart, and are defined as toroidal surfaces that are generally parallel. The flanges extend in outwardly flaring fashion toward the closed end 33, and there is defined between the flanges 36 and 37 a channel 38.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The embodiment of Figure 14 further includes a third flange 101, extending parallel to the flanges 36 and 37 and spaced apart and adjacent to flange 36. The flanges 101 and 36 define therebetween a channel 102 extending about the condom parallel to the channel 38. As depicted in Figure 15, the channel 38 is engaged by the lips of the user, and the channel 102 is disposed to be engaged by the front teeth of the user, providing greater retention of the condom in the oral cavity with less effort by the lips. As noted with regard to Figures 1-3, the condom of Figures 14 and 15 eliminates skin-to-skin contact during fellatio.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">A further embodiment of the invention, depicted in Figure 16, is similar in many aspects to the embodiment of Figures 11-13, and common reference numerals are used to designate common features. This embodiment includes a tapered tubular portion 62 having a narrow, rounded closed end 63 and an open end 64. Joined to the tubular portion 62 adjacent to the open end 64 are a pair of flanges 36 and 37, as described previously, with a channel 38 defined therebetween. The flanges 36 and 37 are substantially the same as described previously, in form and function. The tubular portion 62 is formed of a similar material as described above. Also provided is a third flange 104, extending parallel to the flanges 36 and 37 and disposed adjacent to and spaced apart from the flange 36. The flanges 36 and 104 define therebetween a channel 106 extending about the condom.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">As shown in Figure 17, the condom of Figure 16 is adapted to be applied to the oral cavity, with the upper and lower lips disposed in the channel 38 and the upper and lower front teeth disposed in the channel 106. The portion 62 extends outwardly from the mouth, and provides a sheath within which the tongue may be extended for performing cunnilingus and similar sexual acts. The channel 106 permits greater retention of the condom in the mouth without significant effort by the lips of the user.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">It may be appreciated that all embodiments of the present invention are directed toward facilitating the safe practice of oral sex. To further this goal, any of the embodiments may be packaged together with substances that impart a pleasing flavor and aroma to the condom, so that the use thereof will not be hindered by unpleasant taste or scent. In addition, coloring and<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> surface texture may be added to the condoms to enhance the pleasure of their use.</p>

EP	0600865	B1	2000-09-20	en	DESCR	1	<p id="p0001" num="0001">This invention lies in the field of recombinant DNA technology. The invention is directed in particular at a recombinant DNA material comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding at least a ripening form of a β-1,4 endoxylanase of fungal origin having bread improving activity, said nucleotide sequence being selected from the group comprising the nucleotide sequence of Figure nr. 1 and equivalent nucleotide sequences such that<ul id="ul0001" list-style="dash" compact="compact"><li>the equivalent nucleotide sequence corresponds either to a nucleotide sequence encoding the amino acid sequence of Figure nr. 1 or to those parts of the amino acid sequence of Figure nr. 1 essential for an active ripening form of β-1,4 endoxylanase with bread improving activity, said ripening form being selected from the group comprising the mature, the pre, pro and prepro form and/or</li><li>the equivalent nucleotide sequence has a complementary strand capable of hybridizing under stringent hybridizing conditions to the nucleotide sequence of Figure nr. 1, said stringent hybridizing conditions being incubation in 6xSSC at 68°C with washing steps at the same temperature with 2x and 0,4xSSC respectively.</li></ul></p><p id="p0002" num="0002">A transformed cell comprising such recombinant DNA material also falls within the scope of the invention. As does such a transformed cell suitable for use in a process in which a cellulose and/or hemicellulose containing raw material is used in a functional manner known per se for the non transformed host cell, said cell becoming polyfunctional for said process upon expression of the recombinant DNA encoding the ripening form of β-1,4 endoxylanase and subsequently secreting at least a mature form of the β-1,4-endoxylanase having bread improving activity, thereby enabling degradation of xylan.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A β-1,4-endoxylanase having bread improving activity obtainable by expression of the recombinant DNA material according to the invention is also covered. A process for producing a ripening form of β-1,4-endoxylanase comprising an amino acid sequence according to figure 1, sequence id no 7 or 8 comprising culturing a cell according to the invention in a suitable nutrient medium and optionally isolating the resulting enzyme ripening form also forms an embodiment of the invention. Bakery products, flour compositions, bread improver compositions and dough compositions comprising the recombinant DNA material, the cell or the β-1,4-endoxylanase according to the invention are also claimed as part of the invention. The new products also lead to improved processes for preparing a bakery product, and for processing a cellulose containing material to prepare beer, paper, starch, gluten etc., or<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> to decompose cellulose- and/or hemicellulose containing waste and is directed at a cell having a certain function in a process, containing recombinant DNA encoding at least one enzyme. The invention is directed especially at a cell having a function in the field of food processing and also at cells with a function in processes in which a cellulose-containing raw material is used, such as processes for preparing beer, paper, starch, gluten etc, and processes for decomposing cellulose-containing waste such as agricultural waste, waste from paper mills etc.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In particular the invention is directed at cells having a function in the process of fermentation, more especially at cells with a function in the process of preparing bakery products.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The cell according to the invention is characterized in that the cell becomes polyfunctional for the process in which it has a function, upon expression of the recombinant DNA encoding at least one enzyme. In the case of a fermentation process for example, such as the preparation of bread, yeast is used as a cell with a particular function in said process. A yeast cell according to the invention does not only have its normal function, i.c. a function that a yeast lacking the recombinant DNA can also carry out, but also has another function in said process of bread preparation. An example of such an additional function is the expression and secretion of a bread improving enzyme.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present invention is directed in particular at a cell with a function in the preparation of bakery products. Cells containing recombinant DNA encoding enzymes selected from the group of enzymes with amylolytic and/or hemicellulolytic and/or cellulolytic activity are suitable.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The invention is also directed at a process for the production of at least one enzyme by a polyfunctional cell as described above comprising culturing such a polyfunctional<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> cell in a suitable nutrient medium and optionally isolating the resulting enzyme form. In such a process, said enzyme is preferably selected from the group of enzymes with amylolytic and/or hemicellulolytic and/or cellulolytic activity. A suitable medium for carrying out the process according to the invention can consist of the medium in which the process for which the cell is polyfunctional is carried out. In the process of the preparation of a bakery product for example said medium can be the dough that is to be baked. Naturally the other usual media for culturing cells can also be used. The choice of media will depend on whether the enzyme is to be used in situ or has to be isolated. In some cases it will suffice to use the medium containing said enzyme and in other cases the enzyme will have to be isolated from the medium.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The invention is also directed at an enzyme encoded by the recombinant DNA in said polyfunctional cell, whereby said enzyme is obtainable from such a polyfunctional cell via the afore mentioned process for producing an enzyme. The invention is further directed at the use of such a polyfunctional cell or such an enzyme, for example in the processes described above, such as food processing and processes using a cellulose containing raw material, preferably in a process for the preparation of a bakery product.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Flour, yeast, water and salt are the basic ingredients of bread and other bakery products. For centuries materials having a positive effect on the manageability of the dough or the quality of the baked product have been added in the manufacture of bread and similar bakery products, for the sake of convenience further referred to as bread making. Said additives, referred to as "bread improvers", contain enzymes from malt or of microbial origin which play an important part in the different phases of bread making, namely, the preparation of the bread batter, fermentation, baking, and storage of the bread product.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">One of the relevant characteristics of bread that is influenced by adding specific enzymes is the so-called bread volume. In order to obtain a high bread volume in practice compositions containing cellulolytic, hemicellulolytic and/or amylolytic enzymes are added. The commercially available compositions<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> of microbial origin, mostly originating from a fungus of one of the genera <u>Aspergillus</u> and <u>Trichoderma</u>, are substantially unpurified complex mixtures of different enzyme activities, whereby it is not exactly known which enzymes are present in the composition and which have a bread improving activity. This lack of knowledge impedes further bread improvement and especially impedes the control of the different dough processing and bread properties, such as the bread volume.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Further investigation into the process of preparation of bakery products resulted in the discovery that, in addition to α-amylase, at least a xylanase enzyme is also of importance for the bread volume. A xylanase is an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of xylans occurring in the pentosan part of starch "tailings". The term "tailings" is directed at a fraction of, e.g., wheat starch consisting of water-insoluble hemicellulose (pentosans and arabinoxylans) and damaged starch. This fraction is formed as the intermediate or top layer of the starch pellet during centrifugation of a dough suspension obtained by washing dough to remove the gluten fraction.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Different xylanases have already been described in the literature, including xylanases of the bacterial species <u>Bacillus</u> <u>pumilus</u> (Panbangred et al., Mol. Gen. Genet. 192, 335-341, 1983, and Fukusaki et al., FEBS Lett. <u>171</u>, 197-201, 1984), <u>Bacillus</u> <u>subtilis</u> (Paice et al., Arch. Microbiol. <u>144</u>, 201-206, 1986), and <u>Bacillus</u> <u>circulans</u> (Yang et al., Nucl. Acids Res. <u>16</u>, 7187, 1988), of the yeast <u>Aureobasidium</u> (Leathers, Biotech. Lett. <u>10</u>, 775-780, 1988) and of the fungus <u>Aspergillus</u> <u>niger</u> (Fournier et al., Biotechnology and Bioengineering <u>27</u>, 539-546, 1985).</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">It is known from European patent application EP-A-0338452 that the properties of dough and the quality of bread can be improved by adding different enzyme compositions to the dough, including an enzyme composition having hemicellulose degrading or xylanase activity, the origin of which is not further specified. Such a hemicellulolytic enzyme composition is a relatively undefined enzyme mixture which may contain different hemicellulolytic enzymes having various<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> effects on the dough and bread properties. The presence of xylanases having bread improving activity to a smaller or greater extent is the coincidental result of the manner in which the enzyme composition that is intended as a bread improver has been obtained. A controlled further optimization of bread improvers, however, was not possible due to the lack of the required knowledge and of suitable recombinant DNA constructs encoding a xylanase having bread improving activity that could be used for a high production of such a xylanase.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">For the purpose of this invention, "bread improving activity" is generally taken to mean a favourable effect on any property of the prepared bakery product (including bread) or of the dough from which the bakery or bread product is made, and is particularly taken to mean a favourable effect on the bread volume.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The investigation on which the invention is based has extended to the identification and cloning of a gene (<u>xylA</u>) encoding an enzyme, xylanase having bread improving activity, originating from a fungus of the species <u>Aspergillus</u> <u>niger</u> var. <u>awamori</u>, as well as to the transformation of different species of host cells in such a manner that the gene is expressed or can be expressed in said host cells. The invention comprises recombinant DNA material as defined in the introduction originating from fungi and especially from fungal strains from the same genus and therefore the invention is not limited to the actually cloned gene.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The term "ripening form" refers to the different forms in which the enzyme may occur after expression of the associated gene. More in particular, it refers to both the naturally and the not naturally occurring prepro-, pre- and pro-forms and to the ultimate mature form of the enzyme resulting after cleavage of a "leader" peptide.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">More in particular, the invention, relates to recombinant DNA material comprising DNA with a nucleotide sequence encoding<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> at least a ripening from of a xylanase of <u>Aspergillus</u> origin.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Preferably, this aspect of the invention is concerned with recombinant DNA material comprising DNA with a nucleotide sequence encoding a ripening form of a xylanase of <u>Aspergillus</u> <u>niger</u> origin, especially of <u>Aspergillus</u> <u>niger</u> var. <u>awamori</u> origin.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">A preferred embodiment of this aspect of the invention is recombinant DNA material comprising DNA with a nucleotide sequence encoding at least a ripening form of xylanase with an amino acid sequence as shown in Fig. 1, and more in particular recombinant DNA material comprising DNA with a nucleotide sequence encoding a ripening form of xylanase, as shown in Fig. 1. The invention is also directed at recombinant DNA material comprising DNA with a nucleotide sequence encoding at least a ripening form of xylanase with a nucleotide sequence that is equivalent to the nucleotide sequence of Fig. 1 with deletions, insertions or alterations in comparison to the nucleotide sequence of Fig. 1 such that the nucleotide sequence with deletions, insertions or alterations corresponds either to the amino acid sequence as shown in Fig. 1 or to those parts of the amino acid sequence of Fig. 1 essential for an active ripening form of xylanase such as mature xylanase or active pre(pro) xylanase or the nucleotide sequence with deletions, insertions or alterations has a complementary strand capable of hybridizing under hybridizing conditions to the nucleotide sequence of Fig. 1.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The the recombinant DNA according to the invention contains at least a sequence encoding the fungal, in particular the <u>Aspergillus</u> xylanase ripening form. In addition, the recombinant DNA may contain many other types of information, such as regulating sequences (especially a transcription promoter) and a vector part usually provided with one or more marker genes. These other types of information will often be connected with the selected host. Thus, for instance, the vector, the marker genes and the regulating sequences will be selected depending on the selected host.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The recombinant DNA encoding at least a ripening xylanase of fungal origin, however, may also contain other genes to be<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> expressed in the selected host. Such a gene nay advantageously encode at least one other enzyme, wherein said other enzyme has amylolytic and/or hemicellulolytic and/or cellulolytic activity.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Another aspect of the invention is a cell containing genetic material derived from recombinant DNA material according to the invention as defined above, and more in particular such a cell capable of expression of at least the xylanase ripening form encoded on said recombinant DNA material.A preference exists for such a cell that is also a polyfunctional cell according to the invention and more especially for such a polyfunctional cell capable of expressing the recombinant DNA material encoding a ripening form of xylanase of fungal origin under conditions present in raw material during preparation of a bakery product.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Both a polyfunctional cell containing recombinant DNA encoding at least one enzyme according to the invention, and a cell containing recombinant DNA material encoding a ripening form of xylanase of fungal origin according to the invention (as well as the combination thereof) may either be a cell which is itself the direct result of gene manipulation or be a cell originating in any manner from a cell that has been transformed by such gene manipulation. The invention further extends to both live cells and cells that are no longer alive.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In principle the invention knows no special limitations with respect to the nature of the cells, whereby those cells capable of expression of a xylanase ripening form of fungal origin are preferred. However the cells are preferably selected from the group consisting of bacterial cells, fungal cells, yeast cells, and plant cells.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Preferred examples of eminently suited host cells are<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>(a) fungal cells of one of the genera <u>Aspergillus</u> and <u>Trichoderma</u>, in particular fungal cells of one of the species <u>Aspergillus</u> <u>niger</u> var. <u>niger</u>, <u>Aspergillus</u> <u>niger</u> var. <u>awamori</u>, <u>Aspergillus</u> <u>nidulans</u>, <u>Aspergillus</u> <u>oryzae</u>, <u>Trichoderma</u> <u>reisei</u> and <u>Trichoderma</u> <u>viride</u>;</li><li>(b) yeast cells of one of the genera <u>Saccharomyces</u>, <u>Kluyveromyces</u>, <u>Hansenula</u> and <u>Pichia</u>, in particular yeast<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> cells of one of the species <u>Saccharomyces</u> <u>cerevisiae</u>, <u>Saccharomyces</u> <u>carlbergensis</u>, <u>Kluyveromyces</u> <u>lactis</u>, <u>Kluyveromyces</u> <u>marxianus</u>, <u>Hansenula</u> <u>polymorpha</u> and <u>Pichia pastoris</u>;</li><li>(c) plant cells of a plant genus selected from the group consisting of wheat, barley, oats, maize, pea, potato and tobacco, such as plant cells of one of the species <u>Solanum</u> <u>tuberosum</u> and <u>Nicotania</u> <u>tabacum</u>; and</li><li>(d) bacterial cells of one of the bacterial genera <u>Bacillus</u>, <u>Lactobacillus</u> and <u>Streptococcus</u>, such as bacteria of the species <u>Bacillus</u> <u>subtilis</u>.</li></ul></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Cells according to the invention as defined above (polyfunctional and/or simply containing recombinant DNA encoding a ripening form of xylanase of fungal origin) may be important as agents for multiplying the recombinant DNA or as agents for producing at least one enzyme encoded on said recombinant DNA, such as the ripening form of xylanase.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">In the case of enzyme production it is possible to use the cell to produce enzyme and either isolate the enzyme from the culturing medium or use the medium containing the enzyme after removal of the cells as such, or in the case of the polyfunctional cells to use the cells themselves to produce the enzyme in situ in the process for which they are polyfunctional.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">A direct use of the cells themselves is possible, e.g., if the host strain can be admitted without objection, in the production of foodstuffs as is the case for various fungal, yeast, plant, and bacterial species.

Both AW14S-3 and AB14S-3 transformants produce substantially as much xylanase enzyme in starch medium, regulated by the <u>glaA</u> promoter, as "<u>xylA</u>" transformants in medium with xylan. <tables id="tabl0008" num="0008"><table frame="all"><title>Table G</title><tgroup cols="4" colsep="1" rowsep="0"><colspec colnum="1" colname="col1" colwidth="39.37mm"/><colspec colnum="2" colname="col2" colwidth="39.37mm"/><colspec colnum="3" colname="col3" colwidth="39.37mm"/><colspec colnum="4" colname="col4" colwidth="39.37mm"/><thead valign="top"><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col4" align="center">Xylanase production levels (in 10<sup>3</sup> U/ml) of "<u>glaA</u>" transformants AW14S-3 and AB14S-3 after different culturing periods (hours) in starch medium at 25°C</entry></row><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1"/><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" rowsep="0" align="center">40 hour</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" rowsep="0" align="center">63 hour</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" rowsep="0" align="center">90 hour</entry></row><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="center">AW14S-3</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2"/><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3"/><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">#1</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2"/><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">37</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="right">37</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">#2</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="right">4</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">14</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="right">15</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">#4</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="right">8</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">31</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="right">36</entry></row><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">#7</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="right">16</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">49</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="right">67</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup cols="4" colsep="1" rowsep="0"><colspec colnum="1" colname="col1" colwidth="39.37mm"/><colspec colnum="2" colname="col2" colwidth="39.37mm"/><colspec colnum="3" colname="col3" colwidth="39.37mm"/><colspec colnum="4" colname="col4" colwidth="39.37mm"/><thead valign="top"><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="center">AB14S-3</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2"/><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3"/><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">#4</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="right">23</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">51</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="right">29</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">#5</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="right">19</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">37</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="right">21</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">#7</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="right">23</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">44</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="right">18</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">#8</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="right">17</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">28</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="right">32</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">#14</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="right">21</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">43</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="right">19</entry></row><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">#16</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="right">6</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">21</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="right">10</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h0022"><u>4.6 Analysis of "xylA" transformants after culturing in medium with wheat bran</u></heading><p id="p0070" num="0070">It is apparent from the results (Tables H and I) that the production level observed for AW14S #4 when culturing in medium with wheat bran is higher than that in xylan medium.

Mixing took place for 5 minutes in a 10-gram mixograph from National Manufacturing Co. Lincoln, NE. After mixing, the dough was fermented for 80 min. at 30°C with two punches, one punch at 40 min. and one at 80 min. Sheeting rolls used for the punching were spaced 2.0 mm. After fermentation the dough was moulded and proofed for 70 min at 30°C before baking. Baking took place for 12 min at 240°C. After weighing, the volume of the loaves was measured by means of dwarf rapeseed displacement.</p><p id="p0117" num="0117">Supplementations to the dough were: <u>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</u> SU50 with pUR2923 (xylanase producing yeast), <u>Saccharomyces cerevisise</u> SU50 (parent strain) and purified xylanase enzyme. The SU50 yeast strains used, were first grown on selective media: YNB w.o. amino acids (Difco) and 20 g/l glucose, supplemented with 60 mg/l leucine (SU50 parent only) and 20 mg/l histidine. These cultures were grown for 40 hours at 30°C and then 5 ml was used to inoculate 45 ml of YPD (see above), and grown for 16 hours at 30°C. Yeast cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once with fresh YPD, and centrifugated again. Various amounts of the (wet) pellet were resuspended in 5.9 ml of water just before mixing the dough. When applied, the amount of purified xylanase added was 5 µl of a 40 U/µl solution (200 U). The effect of the various supplementations on the specific volume (S.V) of the bread is shown in the table below:<!-- EPO <DP n="53"> --> <tables id="tabl0012" num="0012"><table frame="all"><tgroup cols="2" colsep="1" rowsep="0"><colspec colnum="1" colname="col1" colwidth="78.75mm"/><colspec colnum="2" colname="col2" colwidth="78.75mm"/><thead valign="top"><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">Supplementation</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="center">S.V.

The parent strain, when added in equivalent amounts, does not exhibit this effect. Of course this effect is accomplished by blending of a bakers yeast with good gassing power characteristics, and an engineered laboratory yeast. The same positive effect, however, can be obtained when a bakers yeast with good gassing power is engineered in a comparable way to produce the fungal xylanase. Furthermore, these yeast strains can be engineered to produce other enzymes with bread improving capabilities (α-amylases, hemicellulases etc.)</p><heading id="h0057">References</heading><p id="p0119" num="0119"><ul id="ul0007" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>Lopes, T.S., Klootwijk, J., Veenstra, A.E., van der Aar, P.C., van Heerikhuizen, H., Raué, H.A. and Planta, R.J.

EP	0668908	B1	2000-05-03	en	DESCR	1	<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for the diagnosis of a worm infection of nematodes in general and at kits for carrying out said diagnosis, in particular at the diagnosis of <u>Haemonchus contortus</u>.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Furthermore, the invention is also directed at use of specific DNA sequences of a tubulin gene of <u>Haemonchus contortus</u> and parts thereof, at insertions of the sequences in vectors and microorganisms and the use thereof, inter alia for the diagnosis of infection with said nematode.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Parasitic helminths (worms) cause serious infectious diseases in humans and animals. In the case of livestock, infections arise at all ages and in virtually every farm.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The use of anthelmintics is widespread in veterinary medicine. In the Netherlands 35 million guilders were spent on anthelmintics in 1987. In 1985 worldwide spending on anthelmintics was US$ 540 million. The total costs of parasitic worm infections in cattle (anthelmintics, loss of production, etc.) are estimated to be 100 to 200 million guilders per year in the Netherlands (thesis by H.W. Ploeger 1988, Agricultural University of Wageningen).</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Little is known about the molecular biology of the mechanism of action of the various control agents. Three groups of broad spectrum anthelmintics are known, each of which have their own mechanism of action. These are<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>i) benzimidazoles, which probably act via binding to tubulin and consequently inhibit transport within the cell and cell division (Lacey, E., 1988, The role of the cytoskeletal protein, tubulin, in the mode of action and mechanism of drug resistance to benzimidazoles, Int. J. Parasitol. <u>18</u>, 885-936).</li><li>ii) levamisole and morantel, ganglion stimulants which lead to paralysis of the parasite, and</li><li>iii) avermectins, which intensify the inhibitory effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In nematodes GABA is the most important neurotransmitter for inhibitory signals from interneurons to motor neurons (Barragry, T., 1984a, Anthelmintics - A review, N.Z. Vet. J. <u>32</u>, 161-164; Barragry, T., 1984b, Anthelmintics- review Part II, N.Z. Vet. J. <u>32</u>, 191-199).</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Of these three, the benzimidazoles are the most widely used.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Using molecular biological techniques, we have studied one of the most harmful gastrointestinal parasites in sheep: <u>Haemonchus contortus</u>. This occurs worldwide, causes haemonchosis and is responsible for losses of 50 million guilders per year in sheepfarming in the Netherlands.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">With a view to effective control of this harmful organism, a sensitive and reliable method for the detection of this worm is indispensable. Parasitic worm infections in sheep are usually mixed infections and a method is therefore needed which is able to differentiate between <u>H. contortus</u> and the other parasitic worms present. The methods which are currently used for the diagnosis of <u>H. contortus</u> are:<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>1) the detection of the specific symptoms of the disease in sheep, and</li><li>2) differentiation of the larval culture from faeces of the sheep.</li></ul></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">A disadvantage of 1) lies in the fact that clinical diagnosis of an infection with parasitic intestinal worms is difficult to make because the symptoms of the disease cannot always be differentiated from those of other diseases or poor nutrition. In the case of <u>H. contortus</u> the external symptoms (inter alia anaemia and oedema) are only detectable when there is a severe degree of infection, whereas damage (loss in weight, wool loss, milk loss) is already caused by an infection without these external symptoms of disease.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">A disadvantage of method (2) lies in the fact that the eggs of various nematodes in the faeces of infected animals appear to be very similar to one another, as a result of which in the case of eggs it is not possible to make a diagnosis of the worm species. For this purpose, a larval culture must first be carried out, which takes about one week. In practice, this method is little used (Janssens, P.G., Vercruysse, J. and Jansen, J., editors: Wormen en wormziekten bij mens en dier (Worms and worm diseases in humans and animals) (1989) Samsom Stafleu, Alphen aan de Rijn/Brussels).</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A new, rapid and species-specific test is therefore needed to be able to diagnose infection with <u>H. contortus</u>. In the case of other nematodes there are a number of tests which are used, such as:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>a) the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and</li><li>b) the dot-blot assay.</li></ul></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The dot-blot assay is very sensitive and rapidly yields<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> results, such as, for example, in the diagnosis of the human nematode <u>Brugia</u>, which causes filariasis (McReynolds, L.A., deSimone, S.M., Williams, S.A. (1986) Cloning and comparison of repeated DNA sequences from the human filarial parasite <u>Brugia pahangi</u>, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA <u>83</u>, 797-801). In this test, total DNA from the eggs is applied to a nylon membrane and hybridised with the specific DNA probe.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In the case of PCR, specific DNA sequences can be used as primer, by which means a fragment of the specific gene is amplified. This can be rendered visible by analysing the reaction mixture using an agarose gel, or by coupling a (fluorescent) label to the primer (De Bruijn, M.H.L., (1988) Diagnostic DNA amplification: no respite for the elusive parasite, Parasitol. Today, 4:293-295). To date, no <u>Haemmonchus contortus</u> DNA is known which is specific for the species and therefore these tests are not possible for the diagnosis of infection with <u>H. contortus</u>. Surprisingly, it has been found that DNA coding for tubulin is species-specific for <u>H. contortus</u>.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In Parasitology Today volume 6 no 4 April 1990 Roos M.H. et al describe determining whether populations of <u>Haemonchus</u> <u>contortus</u> are of the benzamidazole sensitive type or resistant genotype and suggest using α and β tubulin nucleic acid.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The present invention relates to use of a DNA sequence of a tubulin gene of <u>H. contortus</u> or a part thereof. The DNA sequence of the tubulin gene or a part thereof comprises the alpha-tubulin gene of <u>H. contortus</u> or a part thereof or the beta-tubulin gene of <u>H. contortus</u> or a part thereof.(In figure 1 the DNA and aminoacid sequence of the α-tubulin clone, determined as described further on in the example are given. The numbering of the aminoacids in the α-tubulin gene is from 395-425) (In figure 2 DNA and amino acid sequence of the β-tubulin clone determined as described further on in the example, are illustrated). The numbering of the DNA bases is given above the DNA sequence, that of the amino acids is given below said sequence. The clone contains the 3' half of the gene and the numbering of the amino acids in the β-tubulin gene is 223-448. The polyadenylation signal (bases 1538-1543) is underlined. The site of the oligonucleotide primers is illustrated with a dashed line above the DNA sequence: β-1, bases 1-19 according to the strand<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> illustrated here; β-2 bases 1311-1331 according to the complementary strand).</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">It was known from study of previously published DNA-sequences of β-tubulin genes of other organisms that β-tubulin genes are strongly conserved [(Cleveland, D.W. and Sullivan, K.F. (1985) Molecular Biology and genetics of tubulin. Ann. Rev. Biochem., 54; 331-365), (Little, M. and Seehaus, T. (1988) Comparative analysis of tubulin sequences. Comp. Biochem. Physiol., 90B; 655-670), (MacRae, T.H. and Langdon, C.M. (1989) Tubulin synthesis, structure and function: what are the relationships?<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> Biochem. Cell Biol., 67; 770-789)].</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Furthermore, it was apparent from previously published DNA-sequences of a number of nematodes (also of β-tubulin, see Driscoll et al. The Journal of Biology, 1989, volume 109, pages 2993-3003) that the known nematode DNA sequences mostly resemble higher eucaryotic tubulin sequences. Various β-tubulin genes occur in most higher eucaryotes. From what is presently known there appears to be more difference between the different types (genes) of β-tubulin within one animal species than between the same type among different animal species. For example: the degree of conservation between tubulin type β-4 and β-5 of the human is 91,2 %, whereas conservation between type β-4 of the human and type β-4 of the chicken is 99,3 %.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Considering the state of the art as described above it is therefore surprising that DNA of β-tubulin is species specific for <u>H. contortus</u>.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Fragments of a DNA-sequence according to the invention can be used as oligonucleotide probes for specifically determining <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u> especially in mixed infections. Preferably the PCR method is used for this. Probes comprising a part of the sequence according to the invention react specifically with, <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u>, whereby a probe comprising a part of the β-tubulin sequence is especially suited for use in specifically determining <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u> in this manner.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Upon studying the conservation of DNA of tubulin genes it was found that the location of the introns is generally conserved. Introns generally occur in the 5' half of the tubulin gene. In the article of Driscoll et al. already cited it was demonstrated that introns also occur in the 3' half of the 3 β-tubulin genes of the nematode <u>C.</u> <u>elegans</u>. These introns can be distinguished from the introns of the β-tubulin genes of other higher eucaryotes.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">It has now been found that the DNA-sequence of the 3' half of the β-tubulin gene of <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u> also contains introns. The 3' half of β-tubulin of <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u> has been found to contain a lot more introns than the 3' half of β-tubulin of <u>C.</u> <u>elegans</u> and the introns also differ in length from the introns of <u>C.</u> <u>elegans</u>. The location and length of introns in the 3' half of the β-tubulin gene appears not to be conserved in nematodes.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Further research of β-tubulin genes of other nematodes further to the above mentioned discovery have revealed that there are other nematodes beside <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u> and <u>C.</u> <u>elegans</u> which also contain non<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> conserved introns in the 3' half of their β-tubulin genes.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The subject invention is therefore in general directed at the use of a DNA sequence of a specific nematode as oligonucleotide probe, which probe comprises a part of the DNA sequence of the 3' half of a β-tubulin gene, for specifically determining the specific nematode. The subject invention is therefore not restricted to a method for specifically detecting <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u> in which method a DNA sequence is used as oligonucleotide probe comprising a part of the 3' half of the β-tubulin gene of <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u>. The detection of <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u> in this manner serves as an example of a method for the diagnosis of an infection with a certain nematode according to the subject invention.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Another suitable example of a nematode which can specifically be detected using an oligonucleotide probe comprising a part of the DNA sequence of the 3' half of the β-tubulin gene is <u>Trichostrongylus colubriformis.</u></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The presence of differences in the 3' half of β-tubulin genes of nematodes when compared with eachother made a species specific PCR possible. Parts of a DNA sequence comprising a β-tubulin gene can be used as oligonucleotide probes for specifically detecting a nematode with the aid of the PCR in mixed infections.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">A particular embodiment of the method that has been described above comprises the use of parts of the β-tubulin gene as primers, which primers are conserved in various nematodes, whereby two sequences are selected as primers which are located in such a manner that the DNA sequence which is amplified from the total DNA of the nematode via PCR, the amplification product, has a species specific length per nematode. because the DNA sequence which is located between the primers is species specific. It is preferable to amplify DNA from the DNA sequence comprising a part of the 3' half of the β-tubulin gene, as the DNA sequence of the 3' half has been found to differ in intron length per nematode.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Two β-tubulin oligonucleotides, β-1 and β-2 were made on the basis of a DNA sequence of the β-tubulin gene of <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u> as determined by the inventors and illustrated in figure 2, in order to be able to measure the difference in introns among various nematode species. The oligonucleotides namely contain DNA sequences coding for amino acid sequences supposed to be conserved in β-tubulin genes of all higher eucaryotes. Oligonucleotide β-1 comprises amino acids 1-7 of the β-tubulin gene of <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u> and oligonucleotide β-2 comprises amino<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> acids 198-204. The DNA sequence of β-1 is: 5' ACGGATCTCAACCACCTTG 3' and the sequence of β-2 on the complementary strand is 5' CTGGTACTGCTGGTATTCGGA 3'.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The PCR carried out with these oligonucleotides always gave a positive reaction to the presence of <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u> DNA also in mixed infections. With this PCR a DNA fragment of approximately 1300 bases was generated. This PCR always gave a positive result when <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u> DNA was present and then the fragment of 1300 bases was found with the β-1 and β-2 primers. The PCR always gave a negative reaction when no fragment of 1300 bases was present and no <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u> DNA was present.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The PCR with the β-1 and β-2 primers was also tested on DNA of other prevalent sheep parasites. A positive reaction was also found with <u>Trychostrongylus</u> <u>colubriformis</u> also in mixed infections, however the DNA fragment was smaller approximately 900 bases and clearly discernable from the <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u> fragment.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The PCR with the β-1 and β-2 primers was also tested on DNA of <u>Ostertagia</u> <u>circumcincta</u>, <u>Nippostrongylus</u> <u>brasiliensis</u>, <u>Trichinella spiralis</u> and <u>Trichinella</u> <u>native</u>. No reaction was found not even with so called degenerate primers, which take into account the degenaracy of the genetic code. These were, primers β-7 (albino acids 1-6) with DNA sequence: 5' (CTA)G(GC)(GTAC)GA(CT)(CT)T(GCAT)AA(CT)CA(CT)(CT)T 3' and β-8 (amino acids 199-205) on the complementary strand with DNA sequence: 5' TC(CT)TGGTA(TC)TG(CT)TG(GA)TA(CT)TC 3' (figure 2). The PCR with the β-7 and β-8 primers was positive with DNA of <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u> and <u>T. colubriformis</u> giving the DNA fragments that were described previously.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">As the used primers correspond to a DNA sequence coding for a very conserved region of the β-tubulin molecule it appears probable that the β-tubulin gene(s) of the nematode species leading to a negative result with these primers using PCR contain an intron in the sequence of the primers. This could prevent the primer from binding and could prevent any reaction taking place. A change in the amino acid sequence in the region of the primers could also be a possible explanation for the above mentioned result but does not seem probable considering the conservation of the amino acid sequence in this region.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">By selecting the primers in a different region of the 3' half of the β-tubulin gene a species specific PCR can also be obtained for the nematodes giving a negative result with the primers β-1, β-2, β-7 and β-8.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The subject invention is therefore also directed at a method<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> for the diagnosis of a worm infection, with which method the total DNA from the eggs from the nematode is amplified preferably via PCR, which method is characterized in the use of two parts of the coding sequence of the β-tubulin gene which are conserved in various nematodes as primers, which primers are located in the DNA sequence of the β-tubulin gene in such a manner that the amplification product has a species specific length per nematode.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The beta-tubulin probes comprising the complete 2,2 kb β-tubulin clone of <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u> (pEMBLaB, deposited at the CBS in Baarn under Nr.

The beta-tubulin probes of <u>H. contortus</u> were also tested on the DNA of other frequently occurring sheep parasites and this reaction was found to be much less pronounced than with its own species. Yet specific bands were obtained with these large probes which indicates conservation. The weaker reaction could be caused by introns in conserved regions or small species specific DNA sequences within these large probes. The species which were tested are, inter alia: <u>Cooperia circumcincta</u>, <u>Nematodirus battus</u>, <u>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</u>, <u>Ostertagia circumcincta</u>, <u>Trichostrongylus colubriformis</u>, <u>Trichostrongylus vitrinus</u>, <u>Trichinella spiralis</u> and <u>Trichinella native</u>.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">By selecting a specific sequence from a DNA sequence according to the invention of for example, at least 10 nucleotides from a <u>H. contortus</u> specific intron or the DNA sequence coding for amino acids 332-335, which under specific conditions reacts solely with <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u>, it is possible to establish a test by means of which it is possible, in the case of a mixed infection with nematodes, to diagnose infection with <u>H. contortus</u> from the DNA of the eggs.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Examples of tests which can be used are those which are used in the case of other nematodes:<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>a) the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and</li><li>b) the dot-blot assay.</li></ul></p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The present invention also relates to a method for the diagnosis of a worm infection, in which method the total DNA from the eggs from the nematode is applied to a nylon membrane and hybridised with a DNA probe, which method is characterised in that a diagnosis of infection with <u>Haemonchus contortus</u> is made, using a sequence which corresponds to a specific part of a tubulin gene of <u>H. contortus</u> as oligonucleotide probe.

The size of the DNA fragments to be cloned was 20 kb. In order to obtain arbitrary fragments of this size a partial digestion was carried out with a restriction enzyme that cuts frequently in genomic DNA.

The invention also relates to the generation of a variety of mutant ribozymes for screening.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>Background of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Certain naturally occurring RNA molecules undergo self-catalyzed cleavage (Kruger et al.., 1982). The best studied examples occur in plants that are infected with viroids (Hutchins et al., 1986), virusoids (Forster &amp; Symons, 1987a), or satellite viruses (Prody et al., 1986). The genomic RNAs of these infectious agents are reproduced by a rolling circle mechanism that yields multimeric replication intermediates that undergo self-cleavage to produce monomeric genomes. The ability to self-cleave is imparted by distal consensus sequences that interact to form a highly structured RNA configuration (in the form of a "hammerhead") prior to cleavage (Forster &amp; Symons, 1987a, Forster &amp; Symons, 1987b). Although self-cleavage is entirely intramolecular, a careful analysis of the sequences and structures involved led Uhlenbeck to the realization that a synthetic RNA could be constructed that would<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> interact with a second RNA (the "substrate" strand) to form the hammerhead configuration, resulting in the cleavage of the substrate at a specific site (Uhlenbeck, 1987). He demonstrated that these synthetic RNAs act enzymatically.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Uhlenbeck's experiments raised the prospect that RNA enzymes ("ribozymes") could be constructed that would cleave a preselected sequence in any RNA. However, in his scheme some of the consensus sequences which were required to form the active hammerhead configuration were supplied by the substrate strand, severely limiting the number of natural RNAs that could serve as substrates. Haseloff and Gerlach markedly improved Uhlenbeck's design by including all the required consensus sequences in the ribozyme (Haseloff &amp; Gerlach, 1988). Their ribozyme works by first hybridizing to a particular site in the substrate RNA and then catalyzing the cleavage of the substrate at that site. They disclose that sites containing the trinucleotide GUC, and perhaps GUU or GUA, are cleaved, provided that the structures present in the substrate RNA do not prevent the binding of the ribozyme to the site. Figure 1A shows a typical Haseloff-Gerlach ribozyme hybridized to a substrate strand. The arrow indicates the site in the substrate where cleavage will occur. This site is immediately adjacent to the GUC sequence.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Haseloff-Gerlach ribozymes possess two different functional regions. The first functional region is a "catalytic domain" in the middle of the ribozyme (Figure 1B), which contains the consensus sequences that confer the ability to cleave the substrate. The catalytic domain in example shown is 22 nucleotides-long. This region<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> is common to Haseloff-Gerlach ribozymes. The second functional region consists of sequences on both sides of the catalytic domain. These sequences are chosen to be complementary to the sequences surrounding the cleavage site in the substrate (Figure 1C). They confer upon the ribozyme the ability to interact specifically with a preselected cleavage site. Because the combined length of these complementary sequences is typically between 12 and 16 nucleotides, the Haseloff-Gerlach ribozymes are highly specific.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Experiments that tested the activity of Haseloff-Gerlach ribozymes in vivo have been disappointing. The expression of targeted gene products was not eliminated, but only reduced (Cameron &amp; Jennings, 1989), and extremely high levels of ribozyme were required to destroy the intended substrate RNA (Cotten et al., 1989). Furthermore, our own in vitro studies showed that the optimal conditions for ribozyme activity (60 degrees Celsius in the presence of 40 mM magnesium chloride) are quite different from the conditions present in most eukaryotic cells. Naturally occuring hammerhead configurations are optimal only for cleavage within the same RNA (cleavage in cis). Moreover, in plant cells (where hammerheads normally function), cleavage might be aided by accessory proteins. The Haseloff-Gerlach ribozymes, on the other hand, are designed to cleave another RNA (cleavage in trans), without the benefit of cellular proteins. Furthermore, the Haseloff-Gerlach ribozymes might be particularly sensitive to cellular nucleases. It is thus not surprising that artificial ribozymes function less than optimally in vivo. The utility of therapeutic ribozymes will depend on their ability to function efficiently in a complex<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> cellular milieu (Sarver et al., 1990). Thus, it is clear from our own work and from the work of other laboratories that the efficiency of ribozymes as currently designed, either Haseloff-Gerlach or other, is too low for them to serve as commercially effective therapeutic agents. A purpose of the invention described herein is to design and screen ribozymes that will efficiently cleave target RNA.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">By utilizing cells whose survival in the presence of an agent depends on the activity of an expressed ribozyme, we have invented a method for selecting mutant ribozymes that function efficiently under physiological conditions. Our method for screening ribozymes comprises culturing cells whose survival is dependent upon cleavage of RNA by a ribozyme of RNA, which cleavage causes the cells to survive, and selecting those cells which survive.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Ribozymes which are obtained by the screening method herein can be used to selectively destroy RNA, such as that encoding human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) proteins, in vivo.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Also described herein is a method for generating a variety of oligonucleotides for screening by employing mixtures of nucleotide precursors in a DNA synthesizer.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for screening ribozymes for effectiveness in cleaving RNA comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>(a) creating a plurality of vectors encoding ribozymes having differing sequences, which ribozymes are to be screened for effectiveness in cleaving RNA containing a target RNA sequence;</li><li>(b) providing cells that possess an RNA containing the target RNA sequence and that, when the RNA is cleaved by one of the ribozymes in sufficient quantity, survive in a preselected culture medium;</li><li>(c) providing the cells with the vectors;</li><li>(d) culturing the cells in the preselected culture medium under conditions wherein the ribozymes are expressed; and</li><li>(e) selecting cells which survive.</li></ul></p><p id="p0010" num="0010">By way of example only, the present invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none"><li>Figure 1.

The UAA codon that terminates the first open reading frame is shown in bold letters. The second open reading frame, which encodes the methylase responsible for resistance to the MLS antibiotics, cannot be translated because its AUG initiation codon is in a double-stranded region, where it is not accessible to ribosomes.</li><li>Figure 3. Structural reorganization of the ermC leader. (A). Reorganization by erythromycin induction. The panel on the left shows a schematic representation of the secondary structures formed by the ermC leader. The two ribosome binding sites are indicated by heavy lines. The methylase gene cannot be translated because its ribosome binding site is sequestered within the structure formed by regions c and d. The panel on the right shows a ribosome (to which erythromycin is bound) stalled in region a,<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> resulting in the release of region b. Since the alternative structure that could be formed by regions b and c is more stable than the structure formed by regions c and d, a structural reorganization occurs that releases region d, freeing the ribosome binding site for the synthesis of methylase. (B). Reorganization by ribozyme cleavage. The panel on the left shows a schematic representation of the ermC leader with a ribozyme bound to the hairpin loop of the structure formed by regions a and b. Cleavage of this hairpin loop by the ribozyme truncates the leader sequence and results in the release of region b. Since the alternative structure that could be formed by regions b and c is more stable than the structure formed by regions c and d, a structural reorganization occurs that releases region d, freeing the ribosome binding site for the synthesis of methylase.</li><li>Figure 4.

This mixture was incubated at 50 degrees Celsius in the presence of 20 mM magnesium chloride and 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8). Samples were taken at 10 minute intervals and were analyzed by electrophoresis<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> through an 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea.

Cleavage by the ribozyme allows the cells to survive. The surviving cells are selected and contain the most effective ribozymes. The ribozymes obtained are more effective than those of the prior art. They are to be used, for example, to prevent viral replication in cells by cleaving the RNA required for the formation of the virus' constituent proteins.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">This screening method can be utilized where the ribozyme to be screened cleaves any type of RNA which, when cleaved, permits the cell to survive. In one embodiment, the RNA is messenger RNA coding for a polypeptide, which when expressed causes the cells to survive in the media used to culture the cells. The cleavage by the ribozyme<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> can, for example, allow translation of the polypeptide by altering the secondary structure of the messenger RNA. The alteration in secondary structure may free a ribosomal binding site which allows translation to thereafter take place.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In a most preferred embodiment the method is used for screening mutant ribozymes of the Haseloff-Gerlach type. In this embodiment cells are cultured whose survival is dependent upon cleavage by the ribozymes at a sequence inserted in a hairpin loop of the ermC leader in ermC messenger RNA. The cleavage causes a change in structure of the ermC messenger RNA and frees a ribosome binding site to allow synthesis of methylase, thereby permitting the cell to survive in media containing an MLS antibiotic. Cells which survive are selected.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The screening method can also include the formation of a library of ribozyme clones by creating a large number of vectors encoding ribozymes having different sequences which are to be screened, and transforming cells with the vectors. A strategy for constructing a library of mutant ribozymes which are likely to be effective is described herein.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">As stated above, the catalytic domain of a more effective ribozyme to be obtained by using the screening technique disclosed herein can be related to the sequence in the Haseloff-Gerlach design. The number of possible sequences to test becomes enormous when multiple nucleotide substitutions are envisioned. An extensive library of ribozymes can be synthesized, however, each possessing a different sequence in its catalytic domain, but all possessing the same complementary sequences in their flanking segments. The method for creating this library is<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> made possible because artificial ribozymes can be transcribed from synthetic DNA templates. During the synthesis of the template DNA for the ribozyme, nucleotide substitutions can be introduced at random at a relatively low frequency, into those positions in the sequence that specify the catalytic domain of the ribozyme. The RNAs transcribed from these DNA templates consist of a diverse collection of mutant ribozymes.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In order to identify the most efficient ribozymes in this mixture, a cell, for example a bacterial cell or a eukaryotic cell such as yeast, can be transformed and made to express the ribozyme. The survival of the cell is made dependent upon effective cleavage by the ribozyme of RNA in the cell. For example, DNA templates of ribozymes to be screened can be cloned into plasmids and introduced into a specially modified strain of Bacillus subtilis. These bacteria can be grown under conditions in which their survival in the presence of an antibiotic will depend on the efficient functioning of the ribozyme encoded in the plasmid. By examining plasmids from the few cells that are able to survive, mutant ribozymes can be identified that function efficiently under physiological conditions. Plasmids from these selected clones are isolated and their nucleotide sequences are determined in order to identify those nucleotide substitutions that are present in the most efficient ribozymes.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The ribozyme sequences selected from a first round of mutagenesis can then be used as the "wild-type" in a second round of mutagenesis and selection. In other words, a second set of ribozymes can be made for screening based on the<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> sequence of a ribozyme or ribozymes found to be effective in the first round of screening. By repeating this process a number of times, natural evolution is mimicked, and the ribozyme sequence can be gradually refined until it is optimally suited for cleavage in trans.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">If desired, the ribozymes obtained by the screening technique can be further tested for their ability to cleave target RNA, for example, HIV-1 mRNA, and their ability to block expression of the target RNA in human cells, such as human lymphocytes.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In a preferred embodiment, the efficiency of different mutant ribozymes can be tested by seeing whether a cell in which each ribozyme is expressed can grow in the presence of one of the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS) group of antibiotics, preferably tylosin. Survival of each clone depends on the ability of its expressed ribozyme to efficiently cleave the highly structured leader sequence of ermC messenger RNA. The ermC gene, which is constitutively transcribed (Shivakumar et al., 1980), encodes a methylase (Shivakumar &amp; Dubnau, 1981) whose activity confers resistance to the MLS antibiotics (Weisblum et al., 1979). However, the ermC methylase usually cannot be produced in sufficient quantity to confer resistance to the antibiotic because the AUG codon required for the initiation of methylase synthesis is sequestered in a secondary structure formed by the leader sequence of the ermC mRNA (Gryczan et al., 1980). Under natural conditions, resistance occurs in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of another macrolide antibiotic, erythromycin, which initiates a sequence of events that leads to a structural reorganization of the ermC leader sequence that exposes the AUG<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> initiation codon, resulting in the synthesis of the methylase (Gryczan et al., 1980).</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Instead of growing bacteria in the presence of erythromycin, however, bacteria can be induced to synthesize ribozymes that are designed to cleave the ermC leader. Cleavage leads to a structural reorganization of the mRNA that is similar to the reorganization that occurs when erythromycin is present at low concentration. Preferably, ribozyme synthesis is under the control of an inducer, and the concentration of the inducer can be adjusted so that only a few molecules of ribozyme are synthesized. Only those clones expressing the most efficient mutant ribozymes grow in the presence of the MLS antibiotic.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The ermC gene can be expressed in various bacteria. B. subtilis can be used as the host cell, but appropriate modifications will be apparent to one skilled in the art to adapt the methodology described herein to other bacteria.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Similarly, the method of the invention may be applied in host cells containing messenger RNAs other than ermC wherein the messenger RNA rearranges, upon cleavage by a ribozyme, to allow expression of a polypeptide which allows the cell to survive. It has been shown that cleavage of RNA results in structural rearrangements (Kramer &amp; Mills, 1981), and neighboring intrastrand complements that are predicted by a computer program to form stable secondary structures (Zuker and Stiegler, 1981) almost always form these structures (Jaeger et al., 1989). Thus, one skilled in the art can determine other messenger RNAs which can be cleaved in order to allow cell survival. The messenger RNA may encode, for example, a polypeptide which endows the cell with resistance to a different antibiotic, or which<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> allows the cell to utilize a particular nutrient in order to survive. For example, expression of the messenger RNA coding for chloramphenicol resistance is regulated in a manner similar to that of ermC messenger RNA. Using the method described herein, bacteria which expressed only the most efficient ribozymes would survive in chloramphenicol-containing media because of resistance due to efficient cleavage of target messenger RNA.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">An alternative target messenger RNA is one encoding a toxic peptide. Toxic peptides are well known in the art and include antibacterial peptides as well as peptides which are toxic to yeast or other eukaryotic cells. Messenger RNA encoding the toxic peptide can be placed under the control of an inducible regulator. When the ribozymes to be screened and the messenger RNA encoding the toxic peptide are expressed, under appropriate concentrations of inducer, then only cells containing the most effective ribozymes will survive.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The screening method may also be applied where the ribozyme to be screened cleaves RNA which is not messenger RNA, but which is otherwise responsible for the survival of the cell. For example, the copy number of a plasmid encoding antibiotic resistance can be controlled by RNA expressed in a cell, possibly expressed by a second plasmid. Cleavage of the RNA by a ribozyme leads to increased copy number and therefore increased antibiotic resistance. In one known system RNA species I is specified by a first plasmid and controls the copy number of a second plasmid which encodes antibiotic resistance (Tomizawa and Itoh, 1981). Ribozymes can be screened for efficient cleavage of RNA I, which<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> cleavage increases the copy number of the plasmid encoding antibiotic resistance and allows the cell to survive in antibiotic containing media.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The structure and function of the ermC translational attenuator used in the preferred embodiment are now described.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Bacteria containing the ermC gene can resist all members of the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS) group of antibiotics (including tylosin) when they are grown in the presence of erythromycin (Weisblum et al., 1971). The MLS antibiotics inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit. The methylase specified by the ermC gene modifies a particular adenosine residue in 23S ribosomal RNA (Lai et al., 1973), preventing the binding of MLS antibiotics to the ribosome (Shivakumar et al., 1980). Figure 2 shows the leader sequence of the ermC transcript folded into the secondary structures that a computer program (Zuker and Stiegler, 1981; Zuker, 1989) predicts are most stable. There are two ribosome binding sites (Shine &amp; Dalgarno, 1974) in the sequence. The first ribosome binding site is in front of an open reading frame encoding a 19 amino acid leader peptide. Its AUG initiation codon is in a single-stranded conformation. The second ribosome binding site is in front of an open reading frame encoding the 244 amino acid ermC methylase, but its AUG initiation codon is sequestered in a double-stranded region of the leader. Nuclease digestion experiments and ribosome protection studies confirm that only the first binding site is available to ribosomes (Narayanan &amp; Dubnau, 1985).</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The function of this translational attenuator has been extensively studied by Dubnau and his<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> colleagues (Dubnau, 1984), and is summarized below. In the absence of an MLS antibiotic, ribosomes bind to the first ribosome binding site and sweep through the leader, synthesizing many copies of the leader peptide. The methylase gene, on the other hand, is not translated because its initiation codon is not accessible to ribosomes. The rapid passage of ribosomes along the first open reading frame has no appreciable effect on the availability of the AUG codon at the beginning of the methylase gene. In the presence of most MLS antibiotics, the synthesis of proteins is halted after only one or two amino acids have been incorporated (Mao &amp; Robishaw, 1971). Consequently, ribosomes that initiate synthesis of the leader peptide halt almost immediately after synthesis begins. In the presence of erythromycin, on the other hand, longer peptides are synthesized before translation is halted (Mao &amp; Robishaw, 1972). Ribosomes that are bound to erythromycin and initiate the synthesis of the leader do not come to a halt until about nine amino acids have been incorporated (Mayford &amp; Weisblum, 1989a, Mayford &amp; Weisblum, 1989b). Figure 3A illustrates how the resulting presence of a stalled ribosome in the leader sequence disrupts the secondary structure of the leader, resulting in a structural reorganization that places the AUG initiation codon for the methylase in a single-stranded conformation (Mayford &amp; Weisblum, 1989b). At any given instant some ribosomes are not bound to an MLS antibiotic (Dubnau, 1984). Ribosomes that are not bound to the antibiotic are then able to synthesize the methylase, which goes on to modify ribosomal RNA, enabling the bacterium to survive in the presence of any MLS antibiotic.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Ribozymes can cleave the ermC leader sequence. The resulting truncated ermC mRNA undergoes the same structural reorganization that occurs when a ribosome bound to erythromycin stalls while synthesizing the leader peptide. The cleavage fragments are forced apart as tylosin-free ribosomes sweep through the leader sequence. After dissociation of the fragments, the truncated ermC mRNA undergoes a structural reorganization that exposes the AUG initiation codon, permitting the synthesis of methylase by tylosin-free ribosomes. Figure 3B illustrates this, and Figure 4 shows the predicted secondary structure (Zuker, 1989; Zuker and Stiegler, 1981) of the truncated leader after reorganization occurs.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In a preferred embodiment for screening ribozymes, B. subtilis clones containing the ermC gene are grown on agar plates in the presence of tylosin, but in the absence of erythromycin. Normally, they all fail to form colonies. However, each clone is transformed to express a different mutant ribozyme that is designed to cleave the ermC leader. If the mutant ribozyme in a given clone functions efficiently in vivo, then a sufficient number of ermC transcripts are cleaved (and undergo the structural reorganization that allows the methylase to be synthesized) for the cells to resist the tylosin. The number of ribozyme molecules synthesized per cell is under the control of an inducer and is preferably kept at a very low level. Therefore only those clones possessing an extremely efficient mutant ribozyme survive. An examination of the sequences encoding the catalytic domain of the ribozymes in the selected clones identifies the advantageous mutations.<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --></p><p id="p0030" num="0030">There are a number of alternate experimental routes that can be taken to select an efficient ribozyme. For example, a natural target sequence can be substituted for part of the ermC leader sequence. In other words, if the cleavage site of interest is contained in an HIV-1 target, then an HIV-1 sequence which includes the cleavage site can be substituted for the part of the ermC leader sequence which is to be cleaved. This substitution could be made, for example, in the hairpin loop of the ermC leader in place of nucleotides 70 through 82, as shown in Figure 2. A mutant ribozyme can therefore be selected which will possess a catalytic domain that is already "fine-tuned" for the cleavage of the natural target sequence.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The selection method disclosed herein can be applied to ribozymes other than the Haseloff-Gerlach type. Recently, for example, another short ribozyme sequence has been identified (Hampel &amp; Tritz, 1989) that forms a unique "hairpin" catalytic domain (Hampel et al., 1990) and is active under physiological conditions. As improved types of ribozymes become available they can be screened using this method to determine the particular sequences which are most catalytic.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Furthermore, although Haseloff-Gerlach ribozymes are described herein which have a catalytic sequence of 22 nucleotides, ribozymes which are variations on this conventional Haseloff-Gerlach design can be screened as well. For example, while nucleotide substitutions in the 22 nucleotide domain may be screened, insertions, additions, and deletions which change the number of nucleotides of the ribozyme can also be screened for effectiveness. It is anticipated that these ribozymes may have different structures<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> than that shown in Figure 1. Similarly, although 12-16 nucleotides are typically incorporated in the Haseloff-Gerlach design which are complementary to the target strand, ribozymes can be constructed for screening which have fewer or more of the complementary nucleotides than this number. A sufficient number of nucleotides, however, should be incorporated to make the ribozyme highly specific for the target.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The screening method can be used to determine ribozyme sequences most effective at cleaving any desired target sequence. In choosing the complementary sequences of the ribozyme, however, it should be kept in mind that not all potential target sites of the ribozymes to be screened are equally susceptible to attack. There are several considerations in choosing a target sequence. Of primary importance in designing a ribozyme to cleave viral RNA is the conservation of the chosen sequence among different isolates of the virus. For example, in HIV-NL43 genomic RNA, GUC occurs 46 times. Among characterized isolates of HIV-1 (listed in the Human Retroviruses and AIDS database), GUC is conserved at only 35 of these 46 positions; and flanking sequences (eight nucleotides in length) are conserved at only 18 of the sites. When the comparison is extended to African HIV-1 isolates, only seven sites fulfill the requirements. Another important consideration in selecting a target viral RNA is that it be located in a gene whose function or product is essential to the reproduction or infectivity of the virus. For example, the tat gene would be a good target because its gene product is a positive regulator of viral expression. The target should also occur in a region of RNA that is physically accessible to the ribozyme. In vitro studies have<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> shown that the structure of the substrate RNA can be a major determinant of catalytic efficiency for Haseloff-Gerlach ribozymes (Fedor &amp; Uhlenbeck, 1990). A computer program (Zuker, 1989; Zuker and Steigler, 1981) aids in predicting which secondary structures are most likely to occur.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">While GUC is the best characterized cleavage site of the Haseloff-Gerlach ribozymes, GUU and GUA may, however, also serve as cleavage sites. Any cleavage site of a ribozyme to be tested, however, can be used in the target sequence, either that which the Haseloff-Gerlach ribozymes cleave, or sites which other ribozymes cleave. The site may either occur naturally in the sequence, or the target sequence may be adapted to contain the target site. In the ermC example described herein a GUC site is inserted in the target sequence. Where a natural sequence of, for a example, a virus, is spliced into the ermC gene, or other gene used, the viral sequence will normally already contain the cleavage site.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Following isolation of the effective ribozyme according to the method of the invention, follow up tests can, of course, be performed to see whether ribozyme-containing sequences that are complementary to a chosen target can cleave the target RNA in vitro. A further follow up test can be performed to determine the suitability of the target site by constructing a ribozyme to cleave it, and then observing the biological consequences of expression of the ribozyme in human cells challenged with the agent being treated. For example, once an effective ribozyme has been found according to our screening method which cleaves HIV-1 RNA, human lymphocytes can be transfected with a vector from which is expressed the ribozyme and can then be challenged with HIV-1 virus. An<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> assay of HIV-1 infectivity can measure the effectiveness of the ribozyme in preventing HIV infection of the human cells. Such tests, while not involved with the practice of the invention, may neverthless be useful follow-ups.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Following are examples which illustrate the invention. These examples should not be construed to limit the coverage of the claims which follow.</p><heading id="h0004">EXAMPLE 1</heading><p id="p0037" num="0037">In this example we demonstrated the ability of Haseloff-Gerlach ribozymes, which were not screened according to the method of the invention, to cleave MDV-1 mRNA and HIV-1 integrase RNA.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">We constructed and tested a ribozyme that was designed to cleave MDV-1 RNA, which is a well-characterized template for Q-beta replicase (Kacian et al., 1972, Mills et al., 1973). The time-course of cleavage of MDV-1 RNA in vitro by this ribozyme is shown in Figure 5. The incubation mixture included (as an internal control) a related recombinant RNA (Miele et al., 1983) which could not be cleaved because its ribozyme binding site was interrupted by the presence of an inserted heterologous sequence. Although the ribozyme cleaved its intended target (and did not cleave the control), the results demonstrated the relative inefficiency of the Haseloff-Gerlach design.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">We prepared two Haseloff-Gerlach ribozymes, each designed to cleave the integrase gene of HIV-1 RNA at a position corresponding to the GUC at nucleotides 4669-4671 of the hybrid HIV-1 clone, HIV-NL43 (Adachi et al., 1986). The first ribozyme ("ribozyme alpha") was transcribed from a synthetic, single-stranded DNA template by<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> incubation in vitro with bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (Milligan et al., 1987). Its sequence is shown below. Capital letters indicate the nucleotides that are complementary to the HIV-1 target sequence:<br/>5'-g-CUACUACUCCUU-cugaugaguccgugaggacgaa-ACUUUGGGGA-3'</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The second ribozyme ("ribozyme beta") was transcribed from a recombinant plasmid, both in vitro (Melton et al., 1984) and in vivo. This plasmid contained the sequence encoding the ribozyme, embedded between a promoter for T7 RNA polymerase and a T7 transcription terminator. The plasmid was introduced into E. coli cells that contained a chromosomal copy of the T7 RNA polymerase gene from which T7 RNA polymerase could be inducibly expressed. The presence of the terminator in the plasmid ensures that the transcripts are homogeneous. Moreover, the presence of the terminator sequence at the 3' end of the transcripts provides protection from cellular exonucleases. The sequence of the second ribozyme is shown below:<br/>5'-g-CUACUACUCCUU-cugaugaguccgugaggacgaa-ACUUUGGGGCA--cauaaccccuuggggccucuaaacgggucuugagggguuuuuug-3'</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Both ribozymes were studied in vitro. Figure 6 shows a single experiment that illustrates the results. Each of the 11 reaction tubes contained "target RNA", which was total cellular RNA isolated from E. coli cells that express a trpE-HIV-1-integrase fusion protein. After incubation with a ribozyme, the RNA from each reaction was electrophoretically separated, transferred to a<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> membrane, and hybridized with a radioactive probe for the HIV-1 integrase gene. The results showed that both ribozyme alpha and ribozyme beta cleave the target RNA into fragments of the expected size. It did not matter whether ribozyme beta was obtained by transcription in vitro or by the isolation of total cellular RNA from a bacterium in which its synthesis was induced. The results also demonstrated that ribozymes are able to function in the presence of unrelated cellular RNAs, and that the presence of a terminator sequence at the 3' end of the ribozyme does not prevent it from functioning. No cleavage occurred when ribozymes were omitted; and no cleavage occurred when a mutant ribozyme (lacking a catalytic domain) was present. The ribozymes were active in vitro at 50 degrees Celsius but were inactive at 37 degrees Celsius. However, experiments below demonstrated the ability of ribozymes to function in vivo at 37 degrees Celsius.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">To confirm that cleavage occurred in the integrase portion of the target transcript (rather than in the trpE portion), the membranes were rehybridized with a probe for the E. coli trpE gene. The results showed that cleavage occurred within the HIV-1 integrase gene.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">We also conducted a series of experiments to demonstrate the ability of ribozymes to cleave HIV-1 RNA in vivo. We prepared E. coli cells that contained a chromosomal copy of the T7 RNA polymerase gene under lac control and that also contained a plasmid in which the transcription of the HIV-1 integrase gene is regulated by a promoter for T7 RNA polymerase (strain A). We then prepared three additional E. coli strains by the introduction of a second (compatible) plasmid<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> into strain A. The plasmids that were introduced into strain A contained an inserted gene under the control of a promoter for T7 RNA polymerase. In strain D, the inserted gene encoded ribozyme beta. In strain C, the inserted gene encoded a mutant ribozyme beta that lacked a catalytic domain. And in strain B, there was no inserted gene in the plasmid. The activity of the ribozymes transcribed from the inserted sequence in each strain was observed by transferring the bacteria to media containing an inducer of the lac operon. At various times after induction, growth was halted and the RNA in the cells was isolated, analyzed by electrophoresis, and visualized by hybridization with a radioactive probe for the HIV-1 integrase gene.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The results (shown in Figure 7) demonstrate that transcripts containing the HIV-1 target sequence are present after induction in cells that do not express a ribozyme (strains A and B). However, when ribozyme beta is expressed (strain D), the cleavage of the target RNA by the ribozyme apparently leads to the complete destruction of the cleaved transcripts by cellular endonucleases. A similar observation was made during the cleavage of HIV-1 RNA by ribozymes in cultured human cells (Sarver et al., 1990). The mutant ribozyme that lacked a catalytic domain (in strain C) apparently acted as a classic antisense RNA, modulating the expression of the target. Interestingly, ribozyme beta was active in vivo at 37 degrees Celsius, even though it was inactive in vitro at the same temperature. A ribozyme, therefore, apparently catalyzed the cleavage of an HIV-1 target at 37 degrees Celsius in vivo, leading to the complete destruction of the transcript.<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --></p><heading id="h0005">EXAMPLE 2</heading><p id="p0045" num="0045">This example demonstrates the preparation of a B. subtilis clone containing a single copy of a modified ermC gene.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">ErmC normally occurs on a plasmid, pE194, which was isolated from Staphylococcus aureus (Iordanescu, 1976), and which can be transferred to B. subtilis by transformation (Weisblum et al., 1979). pE194 is deposited at the ATCC under accession number 68359.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">A modified pE194 can be used in which a single basepair substitution is introduced into the ermC gene, so that it contains a unique EcoRI restriction site. Although this substitution results in a guanosine at position 109 of the ermC leader, it has no effect on ermC function or induction by erythromycin. In a further modification, a 3-basepair segment cleavable by the ribozymes to be tested can be inserted into the ermC gene. For example, a GUC sequence can be inserted between nucleotides 75 and 76 of the ermC leader (see Figure 2). Since this insertion occurs in a hairpin loop and since it only adds a single in-phase codon to the leader sequence, it is unlikely to alter the function of the ermC gene. The insertion of a GUC sequence at this location allows the modified hairpin loop to serve as a substrate for cleavage by a Haseloff-Gerlach ribozyme. We know from our own work with a ribozyme that was designed to cleave MDV-1 RNA in a hairpin loop (see Figure 1) and from the work of others (Koizumi et al., 1988) that hairpin loops can serve as target sites for ribozymes.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Because a unique SstI restriction site occurs upstream of the ermC transcription initiation site (Narayanan &amp; Dubnau, 1985), the insertion of the<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> GUC, or other appropriate cleavage site, can be accomplished by replacing the SstI-EcoRI segment that encodes the beginning of the ermC leader with a synthetic DNA that is identical in all respects except that it contains the desired inserted basepairs.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In B. subtilis, pE194 is maintained at a copy number of approximately 10 at 37 degrees Celsius (Weisblum et al., 1979). It is desirable to reduce the amount of ermC mRNA that will be present in each cell to make it difficult for cells to survive unless they express an extremely efficient mutant ribozyme. Therefore, it is preferable to integrate a single copy of pE194, or other plasmid used which encodes ermC messenger RNA into the B. subtilis chromosome. An additional reason for integrating the particular plasmid pE194 into the chromosome is to prevent spontaneous loss of the plasmid, since the replication of pE194 is temperature-sensitive. The resulting clone can be tested to confirm that it is sensitive to tylosin in the absence of erythromycin, but resistant to tylosin in its presence. Integration of a single copy of pE194 containing the wild-type ermC gene can be accomplished by means known in the art (Hofemeister et al., 1983). In particular, the replication of pE194 is inhibited at elevated temperatures that do not interfere with the growth of B. subtilis. Selection for erythromycin-resistant organisms at elevated temperatures (circa 50 degrees Celsius) yields clones in which pE194 has been integrated into the B. subtilis chromosome, and the erythromycin resistant determinant is therefore replicated as part of the chromosome.

This permits integration into the chromosome, with replacement of the resident pE194 sequence by the sequence on the plasmid, which may be an altered version of pE194 containing the cleavage site of interest. In this way, the segment of interest can be readily integrated at a known site on the B. subtilis chromosome.</p><heading id="h0006">EXAMPLE 3</heading><p id="p0051" num="0051">This example demonstrates the preparation of a plasmid that can be induced to express a ribozyme to be screened for effectiveness. Use in the B. subtilis host is exemplified here but suitable plasmids may be made for expressing riboyzmes where other host cells are employed.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">A recombinant plasmid, pLIQ-1, can be used in which transcription from a particular promoter is under the control of an E. coli lac operator, even though the plasmid is grown in B. subtilis (Yansura &amp; Henner, 1984). Construction of this plasmid is described in U.S. Patent 4,912,046, which is incorporated by reference into this application. This plasmid contains a hybrid promoter (called "spac"), that consists of a promoter from B. subtilis phage SPO-1 fused to an E. coli lac operator. The plasmid also contains an E. coli lac repressor gene under the control of<!-- EPO <DP n="28"> --> a promoter and ribosome binding site that allows expression of the repressor in B. subtilis. The spac promoter is immediately upstream from a sequence that contains unique restriction sites for HindIII and XbaI. Consequently, the transcription of a sequence inserted between the HindIII and XbaI sites can be modulated in B. subtilis by altering the concentration of isopropyl-B-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG), which is an inducer of the E. coli lac operon.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">A sequence is inserted downstream from the spac promoter that consists of two sections. The first section encodes a Haseloff-Gerlach ribozyme designed to cleave the modified leader sequence of the ermC transcript at the site of the GUC insertion. The second section contains the sequence of a transcription terminator. One transcription terminator which can be used, and is used here, is the major rho-independent transcription terminator of the comG gene of B. subtilis (Albano et al., 1989), the sequence of which is contained in the second oligonucleotide shown below. Each section can be prepared on commercially available DNA synthesizers. The sequence of the first oligonucleotide (encoding the ribozyme) is<br/>5'-ggaa-GCTTATTT-ctgatgagtccgtgaggacgaa-ACTTTGTT-gtac-3'<br/>Capital letters identify the sequences that encode the portions of the ribozyme that hybridize to the ermC leader. The 22 nucleotide catalytic domain of the ribozyme is encoded by the region between the capitalized sequences. A HindIII recognition sequence (AAGCTT) is close to the 5' end of the<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> oligonucleotide. The sequence of the second oligonucleotide (containing the terminator) is<br/>5'-ggtctag-AAAAAAAAGGTACCCGCTCGCTCTGGTAC-aacaaagtttc-3'<br/>Capital letters identify the region that is the complement of the sequence that will occur at the 3' end of terminated transcripts. An XbaI recognition sequence (TCTAGA) is close to the 5' end of the oligonucleotide. The last 15 nucleotides at the 3' end of each oligonucleotide are complementary to each other. Therefore, the two oligonucleotides will hybridize to each other and can be extended by incubation with the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase, generating a double-stranded DNA segment encoding both a ribozyme and a transcription terminator. This segment is digested with HindIII and XbaI to generate "sticky" ends, and then inserted in place of the short HindIII-XbaI segment downstream from the spac promoter in pLIQ-1. The resulting recombinant plasmid is used to transform B. subtilis cells containing the modified chromosomal ermC gene described above. pLIQ-1 also contains a chloramphenicol resistance gene (Yansura &amp; Henner, 1984), and transformants are selected by growth in the presence of chloramphenicol. Other resistance markers may, of course, be used.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">When the selected clones are grown in the presence of IPTG, transcripts synthesized from the spac promoter consist of three sections: a 5' leader containing a copy of the E. coli lac operator, an ermC-specific Haseloff-Gerlach ribozyme, and a 3' tail containing the transcription terminator. Figure 8 shows this transcript bound to the modified ermC leader. The arrow indicates the site where cleavage will<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> occur. When deciding which terminator sequence to incorporate into the transcript, we used a computer program (Zuker, 1989; Zuker and Stiegler, 1981) to predict the secondary structures that are likely to form in the transcript. The program predicted that the comG terminator sequence is unlikely to interact with the sequence of the ribozyme. Furthermore, the program predicted that the sequences that must interact with the ermC leader for the ribozyme to function are likely to occur in a single-stranded conformation. Where ribozymes are designed to cleave targets contained in other sequences than the ermC leader, secondary structures may be similarly analyzed to select an appropriate terminator sequence, should a terminator sequence be included.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">A northern blot procedure (Kornblum et al., 1988) can be used to confirm that the amount of ribozyme synthesized in transformed cells is dependent on the concentration of IPTG.</p><heading id="h0007">EXAMPLE 4</heading><p id="p0056" num="0056">This example describes the preparation of a plasmid library containing mutant ribozyme sequences to be screened according to the method of the invention.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The automated synthesis of DNA occurs in a stepwise fashion, beginning at the 3' end of the desired oligonucleotide. When a new nucleotide is added to a growing oligonucleotide chain, the automated synthesizer selects an appropriate nucleotide precursor solution from the four solutions (one solution for each possible nucleotide) that are available. At any step of the synthesis, the substitution of a mixture of all four nucleotides in place of a single<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> nucleotide will result in the incorporation of a mutant base at that location in some of the chains (Hutchison III et al., 1986). The proportion of oligonucleotides that will be mutant will depend on the relative amounts of "incorrect" nucleotide precursors present at each step. In this context, the terms "mutant nucleotides" and "incorrect nucleotides" refer to nucleotides which are different than those in the ribozyme whose sequence is being varied.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">In one method for generating mutants, synthesis of the first oligonucleotide (encoding the ribozyme) proceeds until the first 12 nucleotides have been incorporated, forming a sequence which is complementary to the target sequence. At that point, all four of the precursor solutions are replaced with mixtures containing, for example, 85% of the "wild-type" nucleotide and 5% of each of the other three nucleotides. Synthesis of the oligonucleotide is then continued until the next 22 nucleotides (encoding the catalytic domain of the ribozyme) have been incorporated. Thus, in each of these 22 cycles of synthesis, 15% of the growing strands, at random, have incorporated one of the three "mutant" nucleotides. Synthesis is then halted, and the precursor mixtures are replaced with the original pure solutions. Synthesis is then continued until the remaining 12 nucleotides, which are complementary to the target sequence, have been incorporated. The product DNA therefore consists of a diverse collection of oligonucleotides encoding a variety of mutant ribozymes. These oligonucleotides are then hybridized to the second oligonucleotide, which encodes the transcription terminator, and extended and cloned into an appropriate plasmid, for<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> example pLIQ-1 as described above. We estimate that a single oligonucleotide preparation can be used to construct at least 1 microgram of recombinant plasmids.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Since transformation of B. subtilis requires plasmid oligomers (Contente &amp; Dubnau, 1979) and is therefore relatively inefficient, E. coli can be transformed with the recombinant plasmids, markedly increasing the number of transformants that can be obtained. Furthermore, if the DNA is transferred to the cells by electroporation, this should yield about a billion transformants per microgram of plasmid (Dower et al., 1988). The plasmids, markedly increasing the number of transformants that can be obtained. Furthermore, if the DNA is transferred to the cells by electroporation, this should yield about a billion transformants per microgram of plasmid (Dower et al., 1988). The main advantage of first introducing the plasmids into E. coli is that the proportion of oligomers in the plasmid population increases during bacterial growth (James et al., 1982). The transformed E. coli cells are grown on agar plates containing chloramphenicol, until they form nearly confluent bacterial lawns. The bacteria are then scraped off the plates and used to prepare plasmid DNA. The isolated plasmids are then transferred to B. subtilis by transformation. As a consequence of the preamplification in E. coli, approximately 10 million B. subtilis transformants should be obtained. Approximately 97% of these transformants encode a mutant ribozyme.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">The number of different possible mutant sequences that are 22 nucleotides long, i.e. the length of the catalytic sequence which is to be varied, exceeds 17 trillion. If, for example, 10<!-- EPO <DP n="33"> --> million transformants are to be tested per experiment, a strategy should be employed to increase the chances of selecting a mutant ribozyme with enhanced activity.

It is clear from an examination of the table that if the substitution frequency, p is altered by changing the proportions of the nucleotides in the precursor mixtures, the way in which the selection experiment explores changes in the 22 nucleotides will be varied. Lower values of p will result in a thorough exploration of the different sequences that have only a few nucleotide substitutions. However, lower values of p will also result in only a relatively few sequences possessing the multiple substitutions that might confer increased ribozyme activity. Higher values of p, on the other hand, sacrifice a thorough exploration of minor changes for a greater representation of relatively complex mutants.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">Our preferred strategy recognizes that all the possibilities cannot be explored directly. Instead, a relatively moderate value of p (.05) is utilized to increase the probability of<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> identifying advantageous alterations involving only a few mutations. Once these mutations have been identified, the synthesis of a collection of mutant sequences can be repeated, but starting with one or more of the advantageous sequences identified in the first collection, and using more stringent selection conditions (e.g. lower concentrations of IPTG). This strategy thus mimics the evolution of genes in nature. The selection process can be repeated a number of times. With each cycle of mutation and selection, small changes should improve the efficiency of the ribozyme. In this manner, a ribozyme is selected that is much more suited to cleaving a substrate under physiological conditions than the starting ribozyme whose sequence is varied. The ribozyme obtained is also much more efficient at catalyzing cleavage in trans than the natural hammerhead that evolved to catalyze cleavage in cis. <tables id="tabl0002" num="0002"><table frame="all"><tgroup cols="4" colsep="1" rowsep="0"><colspec colnum="1" colname="col1" colwidth="39.37mm"/><colspec colnum="2" colname="col2" colwidth="39.37mm"/><colspec colnum="3" colname="col3" colwidth="39.37mm"/><colspec colnum="4" colname="col4" colwidth="39.37mm"/><thead valign="top"><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="center">r</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="center">p=.01</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="center">N<sub>n,r</sub> p=.05</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="center">p=.10</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="right">0</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="right">5,116,564</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">280,038</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="right">3,910</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="right">1</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="right">3,481,373</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">1,087,205</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="right">36,864</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="right">2</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="right">1,130,549</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">2,014,528</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="right">165,888</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="right">3</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="right">233,103</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">2,370,032</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="right">473,966</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="right">4</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="right">34,244</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">1,986,645</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="right">964,859</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="right">5</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="right">3,812</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">1,262,104</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="right">1,488,640</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="right">6</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="right">334</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">631,052</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="right">1,807,634</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="right">7</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="right">24</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">254,542</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="right">1,770,744</entry></row><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="right">8</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="right">1</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">84,223</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="right">1,422,919</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p0063" num="0063">We have described introducing mutations into all 22 nucleotides of the catalytic domain, even though the only conserved sequences (Forster &amp; Symons, 1987b) are those surrounding the hairpin<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --> structure (see Figure 1B). We chose this route because the mechanism of catalysis is not understood, and the identity of the sequences that form this hairpin markedly influence the rate of cleavage (Heus et al., 1990). In another approach, however, a lesser number of nucleotides may be targeted for selection if it is believed those nucleotides are more influential in the ribozyme's catalytic action. For example, the ten unhybridized nucleotides shown in Fig. 1B "CUGAUGA ...

EP	0611955	B1	2000-01-12	de	DESCR	1	<p id="p0001" num="0001">Die Erfindung bezieht sich auf eine Einrichtung entsprechend dem Oberbegriff des Anspruchs 1, zur Untersuchung der Strömungsbewegung in zylindrischen Bauteilen, wie sie insbesondere bei Hubkolbenmotoren eingesetzt wird, um die beim Einströmvorgang in den Zylinder erzeugte Ladungsbewequng zu analysieren .</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Die bekannten Meßverfahren beziehen sich auf die Untersuchung von Drallströmungen, deren Drehachse parallel zur Zylinderachse liegt. Üblicherweise findet man diese Drallströmungen bei Hubkolbenmotoren mit einem Einlaßventil pro Zylinder. Bei diesen Motorkonzepten wird aufgrund der vielfach tangentialen Kanalanordnung diese Drallströmung beim Einströmen in den Zylinder während der Ansaugphase erzeugt.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Bei konventionellen Hubkolbenmotoren mit zwei Einlaßventilen pro Zylinder, die parallel zur Kurbelwellenachse angeordnet sind, wird wegen der symmetrisch aufgebauten Einlaßsysteme keine Drallströmung dieser Art erzeugt. Bei diesen Hubkolbenmotoren dominiert eine Strömungsform, deren Drehachse quer zur Zylinderachse angeordnet ist. Die Wirkungsweise dieser Strömungsbewequng auf die motorische Verbrennung unterscheidet sich grundlegend von der der Drallströmung.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Bei der Drallströmung bewirken die rotatorischen Geschwindigkeitskomponenten, die in idealisierter Vorstellung nach der Drallerhaltung während der Kompressionsphase konstant sind, eine Wirbelstabilisierung. Bei Strömungsformen mit Drehachse senkrecht zur Zylinderachse erfolgt dagegen durch die Kolbenbewequng ein Zerfall des Hauptwirbels in immer kleinere Partialwirbel. Dieser Zerfallprozeß transformiert Rotationsenergie in zusätzliche Turbulenz, wodurch bei diesen Strömungsformen hohe Turbulenzenergie entsteht.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Die unterschiedlichen Ladungsbewegungsformen wirken sich aus auf die Verbrennung, indem sie die Flammengeschwindigkeit als Summe der Brenn- und Transportgeschwindigkei beeinflussen. Intensive Strömungen mit Drehachse senkrecht zur Zylinderachse führen durch die starke Erhöhung der Turbulenz während der Kompressionsphase, die eine deutliche Auffächerung der Flammenoberfläche zur Folge hat, zu einer Zunahme der turbulenten Brenngeschwindigkeit.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Die Turbulentproduktion ist bei Drallströmungen, also bei Strömungen, deren Drehachse parallel zur Zylinderachse liegt, infolge des geringeren Wirbelzerfalls weniger stark ausgeprägt. Die daraus resultierende niedrige turbulente Brenngeschwindigkeit wird hier allerdings durch eine stärkere Transportbewegung unterstützt, die unmittelbar nach Einleiten der Zündung bei fremdgezündeten Hubkolbenmotoren zu einem schnellen Anwachsen des Flammkerns führt.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Obwohl beide Strömungsformen, also Drallströmungen mit Drehachse parallel zur Zylinderachse und Wirbel mit Drehachse senkrecht zur Zylinderachse, zu einer schnellen Verbrennung führen, sind die Wirkungsmechanismen vollkommen verschieden.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Der Erfindung liegt die Aufgabe zugrunde, eine Einrichtung zu schaffen, mit der Wirbelströmungen, deren Drehachse senkrecht zur Zylinderachse angeordnet sind, in konstruktiv günstiger und meßtechnisch sicherer Weise unmittelbar in einem zylindrischen Bauteil erfaßt und analysiert werden können.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Diese Aufgabe wird gemäß der Erfindung gelöst mit den im Kennzeichnungsteil des Anspruchs 1 angegebenen Mitteln.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Gemäß einer bevorzugten Ausführungsform ist vorgesehen, daß das zylindrische Bauteil in seiner axialen Richtung in Strömungsrichtung gesehen hinter dem Meßflügel bzw. hinter den Meßflügeln verschlossen ist und das in den zylindrischen Bauteil eintretende Strömungsmedium durch wenigstens eine Öffnung in der Wandung des zylindrischen Bauteils austreten kann, deren<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> Mittelpunkt bzw. deren Mittelpunkte im wesentlichen mit der Drehachse des Meßflügels bzw. den Drehachsen der Meßflügel zusammenfällt bzw. zusammenfallen.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Gemäß einer weiteren bevorzugten Ausführungsform ist vorgesehen, daß das in das zylindrische Bauteil eintretende Strömungsmedium durch eine in Strömungsrichtung gesehen hinter dem Meßflügel bzw. hinter den Meßflügeln angeordnete strömungsdurchlässige Wandung ausströmen kann.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Besondere meßtechnische Vorteile sind erreichbar, wenn die Achse des Meßflügels bzw. der Meßflügel gegenüber dem strömungsführenden System in axialer Richtung des zylindrischen Bauteils verschiebbar und um die Achse des zylinderischen Bauteils drehbar ist.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Das zylindrische Bauteil kann in zweckmäßiger Weise in seiner axialen Richtung in Strömungsrichtung gesehen hinter dem Meßflügel bzw. hinter den Meßflügeln durch eine in der axialen Richtung des Bauteils verschiebbare, strömungsundurchlässige Wandung abgeschlossen sein.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Auch kann es vorteilhaft sein, daß die in Strömungsrichtung gesehen hinter dem Meßflügel bzw. hinter den Meßflügeln angeordnete strömungsdurchlässige Wandung in axialer Richtung des zylindrischen Bauteils verschiebbar ist.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Gemäß einer weiteren bevorzugten Ausführungsform ist vorgesehen, daß der Meßflügel bzw. die Meßflügel die Form eines Kreisringes hat bzw. haben.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Auch können mehrere zur Messung von Parametern der Strömungsbewegung geeignete Einrichtungen kombinatorisch zusammenwirkend angeordnet sein, und der Druck in dem zylindrischen Bauteil kann kleiner sein als in Strömungsrichtung gesehen der Druck vor dem die Strömungsbewegung erzeugenden strömungsführenden System.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Weitere meßtechnische Vorteile können erreicht werden, wenn das zylindrische Bauteil stationär oder instationär durchströmt wird.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Ausführungsbeispiele der Erfindung werden nachfolgend anhand der Zeichnungen beschrieben.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Fig. 1 zeigt eine erste Ausführungsform zur Bestimmung der Bewegung des Strömungsmediums senkrecht zur Achse des Zylinders einer Hubkolben-Brennkraftmaschine.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Fig. 2 zeigt eine zweite Ausführungsform.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Fig. 3 zeigt eine weitere Ausführungsform.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Die dargestellten Einrichtungen dienen der Simulation und der Untersuchung der Strömungsbewegung in zylindrischen Bauteilen von Hubkolben-Brennkraftmaschinen, also vor allem in den Zylindern, in denen die Verbrennung des Brennstoff/Luft-Gemisches erfolgt. Es soll dabei die Ladungsbewegung senkrecht zur Zylinderachse 1 untersucht werden.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Diesem Zweck dient ein zylindrisches Bauteil 2, dessen Innendurchmesser dem Innendurchmesser eines Zylinders einer Brennkraftmaschine entspricht, deren Eigenschaften zu untersuchen sind. Am oberen Teil, also in Strömungsrichtung vor dem zylindrischen Bauteil 2, sind<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> die strömungsführenden Teile des Hubkolbenmotors angeordnet, insbesondere Einlaßkanäle 3 und Ventile 4, deren Hub entsprechend der Arbeitsweise des Hubkolbenmotors eingestellt wird. Als Verschluß des zylindrischen Bauteils 2 in axialer Richtung dient ein Kolben 5, der in radialer Richtung entsprechend den Betriebsbedingungen des zu untersuchenden Motors gegenüber dem (nicht dargestellten) Zylinderkopf passend angeordnet ist. In axialer Richtung wird die Position des Kolbens 5 entsprechend der tatsächlichen Zuordnung zum Ventilhub während der Ansaugphase eingestellt.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Etwa in gleichem Abstand zwischen dem Zylinderkopf und dem Kolben 5 befindet sich ein Meßflügel 7, der um seine Achse 6 drehbar ist. Die Achse 6 des Meßflügels 7 ist senkrecht zur Zylinderachse 1 angeordnet. Durch ein extern erzeugtes Druckgefälle angetrieben strömt Luft stationär durch die Einlaßkanäle 3 in das zylindrische Bauteil 2 ein, und sie kann aus dem zylindrischen Bauteil 2 über Öffnungen 8 in der Wandung des zylindrischen Bauteils 2 abströmen. Dadurch wird der Meßflügel 7, der vorzugsweise die Form eines Kreisrings hat, in Drehung versetzt. Die Luft verläßt das zylindrische Bauteil 2 in Richtung der Achse 6 des Meßflügels 7 durch die Öffnungen 8.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Die Achse bzw. Welle 6 des Meßflügels 7 ist mit einer Einrichtung 20 zur Auswertung der Drehfrequenz und/oder der Winkelstellung des Meßflügels 7 zur Bestimmung eines oder mehrerer Parameter der Strömungsbewegung in dem zylindrischen Bauteil 2 verbunden.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Die in Fig. 2 dargestellte Ausführungsform unterscheidet sich von der Ausführungsform nach Fig. 1 dadurch, daß Kolben 9 strömungsdurchlässig ist. Zu diesem Zweck können beispielsweise Bohrungen 10 in dem Boden des Kolbens 9 vorhanden sein. Hierdurch ergeben sich im Vergleich zu der Ausführungsform nach Fig. 1 andere Ausströmverhältnisse aus dem zylindrischen Bauteil 2.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Bei beiden Ausführungsformen ist zur Untersuchung der Strömungsbewegung in einem zylindrischen Rohr, die von in Strömungsrichtung<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> gesehen vor dem zylindrischen Rohr befindlichen strömungsführenden Bauteilen, also im wesentlichen den Teilen 3 und 4, erzeugt wird, mindestens ein Meßflügel in diesem zylindrischen Rohr drehbar gelagert, dessen Drehachse die Achse des zylindrischen Rohres unter einem einstellbaren Winkel schneidet, und der von O° verschieden ist.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Mit einem derartigen Meßsystem können die strömungstechnischen Vorgänge im Zylinder von Hubkolbenmotoren auf einfache Weise nachgebildet und für das Brennverfahren wichtige Strömungscharakteristiken detailliert beobachtet werden.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Zur Bestimmung der Wirbelstärke in Bezug auf eine beliebig im zylindrischen Rohr orientierte Bezugsachse wird die Flügelachse entsprechend ausgerichtet und die Flügeldrehzahl gemessen. Hierbei wird bei der Ausführungsform nach Fig. 1 durch die Öffnungen 8 in der Zylinderwand, deren Mittelpunkte mit der Drehachse 6 des Meßflügels 7 im wesentlichen zusammenfallen, sichergestellt, daß der gesamte Massenstrom und damit auch der Drehimpulsanteil der strömungsbewegung bezüglich der Wirbelachse durch den Meßflügel 7 erfaßt wird.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Die Meßflügelgeometrie wird so gewählt, daß nur die zur Drehachse 6 tangentialen Geschwindigkeitsanteile die Flügeldrehzahl beeinflussen. Hierdurch wird sichergestellt, daß die gemessene Drehzahl proportional zum gesamten Drehimpuls der Strömung bezogen auf die Drehachse des Meßflügels 7 ist und damit die Übertragbarkeit auf die Verhältnisse im Motorbetrieb gewährleistet ist. Die Flügelanordnung unmittelbar im Zylinderrohr ist von besonderer Bedeutung, da hierdurch die Wirbelkomponenten direkt gemessen werden und die Bestimmung des für eine energetische Betrachtung erforderlichen tatsächlichen Geschwindigkeitsniveaus der Wirbelströmung ermöglicht wird.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Die in Figur 3 dargestellte Ausführungsform unterscheidet sich von der Ausführungsform nach den Fig. 1 und 2 dadurch, daß anstelle des Meßflügels 7 mit Drehachse 6 mehrere Meßflügel 14, 15, 16 mit<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> den jeweiligen Drehachsen 11, 12, 13, die voneinander unabhängig drehbar gelagert sind und deren Drehzahl einzeln gemessen wird, vorhanden sind.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Durch den Einsatz mehrerer Meßflügel 14, 15, 16 kann das Strömungsprofil der Wirbelströmung untersucht werden. Die so gewonnenen Informationen über die Strömungsstruktur können zur Interpretation der Mischungsvorgänge bei einströmenden Kraftstoff-Luftgemischen genutzt werden.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Da je nach der geometrischen Ausführung des zu untersuchenden strömungsführenden Bauteils beim Einströmen in das zylindrische Rohr der Strömung mit Drehachse senkrecht zur Zylinderachse auch Strömungskomponenten mit Drehachse parallel zur Zylinderachse überlagert sein können, ist der Winkel zwischen der Drehachse des Meßflügels 7 und der Zylinderachse 1 einstellbar. Zusätzlich ist der Meßflügel 7 hinsichtlich des Abstands zum strömungsführenden Bauteil in axialer Richtung des zylindrischen Rohres verschiebbar und die Meßflügelachse um die Zylinderachse drehbar. Die Variabilität der Meßflügelposition schafft die Möglichkeit, neben der Intensität eines beim Einströmen in das Zylinderrohr erzeugten Wirbels auch dessen genaue Ausrichtung zu ermitteln, die durch die maximale Flügeldrehzahl gekennzeichnet ist. So können in vorteilhafter Weise komplexere Strömungsformen, die nach Einführung der Mehrventiltechnologie in verstärktem Maße auftreten, untersucht werden.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Ein weiterer wichtiger Vorteil kann durch die Berücksichtigung der geometrischen Einflußparameter durch Nachbilden der exakten Zylindergeometrie des Hubkolbenmotors einschließlich der Ablenkung der Strömung am Kolben erreicht werden. Hierzu wird das zylindrische Rohr 2 durch den Kolben 5 eines Hubkolbenmotors oder eine Nachbildung in axialer Richtung in Strömungsrichtung gesehen hinter dem Meßflügel 7 bzw. den Meßflügeln 14, 15, 16 verschlossen. In Verbindung mit dem Austritt der Strömung durch die Öffnungen 8 der Zylinderwand, deren Mittelpunkt im wesentlichen mit der Drehachse 6 des Meßflügels 7<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> bzw. der Drehachsen 11, 12, 13 der Meßflügel 14, 15, 16 zusammenfällt, bzw. zusammenfallen, werden im stationären Meßbetrieb Rückwirkungen auf die Ausbildung der Wirbelströmung vermieden. Hierdurch wird die Übertragbarkeit der Meßergebnisse auf den Motorbetrieb sichergestellt.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Bei der Ausführungsform gemäß Fig. 2 verschließt der strömungsdurchlässige Kolben 9, der in Strömungsrichtung gesehen hinter dem Meßflügel 7 bzw. hinter den Meßflügeln angeordnet ist, das zylindrische Rohr 2 in axialer Richtung. Der Vorteil dieser Ausführungsform besteht darin, daß im stationären Betrieb des Meßverfahrens der durch den durchlässigen Kolben 9 entweichende Strömungsanteil im Motorbetrieb dem Anteil der in den Zylinder einströmenden Masse entspricht, der das beim Ansaugvorgang durch den abwärts bewegten Kolben hinzukommende Zylindervolumen füllt.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">In vorteilhafter Weise ermöglicht die axiale Verschiebung der Position des in Strömungsrichtung gesehen hinter dem Meßflügel 7 bzw. den Meßflügeln angebrachten Verschlusses bzw. strömungdurchlässigen Kolbens 9 die Untersuchung des Einflusses der Kolbenstellung auf die Strömungsbewegung im Zylinder. Diese Vorgehensweise ist zur Klärung der detaillierten Vorgänge während der Ansaugphase, bei der sich infolge der Kolbenbewegung die Geometrie des Zylinderraums ständig ändert, von großer Bedeutung.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Um die für den Einströmvorgang in das zylindrische Bauteil 2 der Meßeinrichtung erforderliche Druckdifferenz zu erzeugen, wird der Druck im zylindrischen Bauteil 2 geringer als der Umgebungsdruck eingestellt. Diese Druckdifferenz kann entweder durch Absenkung des Drucks im zylindrischen Bauteil 2 oder durch Erhöhung des Drucks vor dem zu untersuchenden strömungsführenden Bauteil erzeugt werden.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">In vorteilhafter Weise kann die Strömungsmessung bei stationärer Durchströmung durchgeführt werden. Der konstruktive Aufbau der Meßeinrichtung stellt hierbei die gute Übertragbarkeit der ermittelten Meßwerte auf den Motorbetrieb sicher.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0039" num="0039">In einer anderen vorteilhaften Betriebsweise kann die Meßeinrichtung instationär durchströmt werden, um dabei zusätzlich gasdynamische Effekte zu erfassen.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Es können auch mehrere gleichartige Einrichtungen zur Untersuchung der Strömungsbewegungen in zylindrischen Rohren kombiniert werden, so daß beispielsweise ein Vollmotorzylinderkopf als strömungsführendes Bauteil auf allen Zylindern gleichzeitig durchströmt wird.</p>

EP	0603422	B1	2000-05-24	en	DESCR	1	<p id="p0001" num="0001">This invention relates to a wear component and a method of making same. Furthermore, the invention relates to a method for producing synthetic diamond for use as a wear surface, and a method of investigating synthetic diamond to be utilized as a wear surface.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">The use of natural diamond in wear components, such as in cutting and grinding tools, is very old. In addition to extreme hardness, diamond's superlative thermal conductivity, thermal stability, and inertness are unsurpassed for wear applications. In recent times synthetic polycrystalline diamond films have been successfully produced, such as by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and used commercially in wear applications. The synthetic diamond films can be deposited directly on the base of a wear component, for example as a thin film (generally defined as a film having a thickness of less than 20 µm), or produced separately, generally as a thick film, and mounted on the base of a wear component, such as by brazing.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Even exceedingly hard diamond surfaces have a limited wear life, and the wear life of synthetic diamond, which can vary considerably for different synthetic diamond material, is a key factor in the cost-effectiveness of a wear component. A number of factors are recognized as affecting the wear life of synthetic diamond. The presence of foreign matter, voids, and cracks are all usually deleterious to the wear resistance of diamond. In this context, foreign matter also includes carbon not possessing the diamond structure, such as graphite.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Document EP 0 379 220 A1 discloses a diamond coated sintered body characterized by having a diamond film formed by a gas phase synthesis method on the surface of a sintered body obtained from a mixture of tungsten carbide and at least one compound selected from the group consisting of carbide and nitride of silicon or boron and, if necessary, additionally at least one compound selected from the group consisting of carbide, oxide, nitride, carbonitride, carbonate, boride and organic compound of at least one element selected from the group consisting of metals and rare earth elements belonging to Groups Ia, IIa, IIIa, IVa, Va, IIIb and IVb of the Mendelejeff's periodic table.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">However, wear resistance of the diamond film is not addressed.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Document EP 0 449 571 A1 discloses a polycrystalline diamond tool wherein polycrystalline diamond has non-uniform quality along the direction of thickness. The diamond near the rake surface is of better quality. The diamond near the fixation surface is of worse quality. The worse diamond near the fixation surface alleviates a strong stress or absorbs an external shock. Owing to the worse diamond near the fixation surface, the diamond tool excels in chip resistance or toughness. The better diamond near the rake surface heightens abrasion resistance, adhesion resistance and strength.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Document EP 0 319 926 A2 discloses a method for the preparation of a diamond-clad machining tool. The diamond-clad machining tool of the invention is prepared by the steps of (a) forming a film of diamond of 10 to 1000 µm thickness by the method of vapor-phase deposition on the surface of a temporary substrate of, e.g., silicon, (b) bonding the diamond film as borne by the temporary substrate to the surface of a base body of the tool by brazing and (c) removing the temporary substrate, e.g., by grinding to leave<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> the diamond film bonded to the base body of the tool by brazing. The method is advantageous in the versatility in respect of the material of substrate on which a diamond film is deposited from the vapor phase as well as in the firmness of bonding between the cladding layer and the base body of the tool in comparison with the conventional vapor-phase deposition method of diamond directly to the surface of the base body of a tool.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Improvement of the wear resistance of the diamond film is not discussed in this document.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide synthetic diamond having improved wear properties. A further object is to provide an improved method of making such diamond.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">These objects are solved by the method of making a wear component according to independent claim 7, a wear component according to independent claim 1, the method for producing synthetic diamond for use as a wear surface according to independent claim 16. Further advantageous features, aspects and details of the invention are evident from the dependent claims, the description, examples and the drawings.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Generally spoken, the invention provides improvements in wear components comprising synthetic diamond wear surfaces and a method of making such improved wear components. Particularly, the invention provides improved synthetic diamonds for use in wear components and methods of making such diamond.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Applicant has discovered that the wear properties of synthetic diamond are related to the equivalent strain in the diamond crystal structure in an unexpected way, and this discovery is utilized in the invention to produce diamond with superior wear characteristics, as well as to monitor and modify processes of diamond deposition to obtain improved wear surfaces and wear components. [As used herein, a wear surface is intended to mean a surface employed for tribological application; for example, without limitation, a cutting surface, a grinding surface, a bearing surface or a valve surface. A wear component is intended to mean a wear surface secured to a base element; for example, without limitation, a cutting component, a grinding component, a bearing component, or a valve component.] Surprisingly, a certain minimum equivalent strain in the crystal lattice (that is, a displacement of atom positions with respect to positions they would occupy in a perfect lattice) results in improvement of the wear characteristics of synthetic diamond, rather than a degrading of wear characteristics that might be expected from lattice imperfection. In most ceramic applications, less perfect crystals exhibit poorer wear resistance.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">A relatively high thermal conductivity can contribute to improvement of the wear characteristics of synthetic diamond.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> Applicant has demonstrated that the obtainment of diamond having substantial equivalent strain improves wear characteristics for synthetic diamond film of a given thermal conductivity. Measurements of equivalent strain can also be used in the monitoring and control of synthetic diamond film production and in selection of synthetic diamond for wear applications.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In accordance with a form of the invention, a method is set forth for making a wear component. A base surface is provided. A synthetic diamond film is produced, the film having a thickness of at least 20 µm and an equivalent strain of at least 0.08 percent. The synthetic diamond film is applied to the base surface. The film can be deposited directly on the base surface, for example by having the base surface be the target surface in a chemical vapor deposition system. More typically, for thick film synthetic diamond, the film can be separately produced and then mounted on the base surface, such as by brazing a piece of synthetic diamond film to a tungsten carbide base surface in a manner well known in the art.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">It is preferable to form a diamond film wear surface having a thermal conductivity of at least about 9 W/cm°K. For thermal conductivities less than about 9 W/cm°K, the diamond film should be formed with an equivalent strain of at least about 0.10 percent to exhibit improved wear characteristics in accordance with the principles hereof.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In a further form of the invention, there is set forth a<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> method for producing synthetic diamond film for use as a wear surface. Synthetic diamond is formed by chemical vapor deposition using initial deposition parameters. The equivalent strain of the diamond film is monitored, for example by measuring equivalent strain of each sample produced or of a sample from a produced batch. The deposition parameters are then modified when the equivalent strain of the synthetic diamond is less than a predetermined minimum percentage. In an embodiment hereof, the minimum equivalent strain percentage is about 0.08 percent. In a form of the invention, the thermal conductivity of the diamond is also measured. In this embodiment, the referenced minimum equivalent strain percentage is about 0.08 percent when the thermal conductivity is greater than about 9 W/cm°K, and the referenced minimum equivalent strain percentage is about 0.10 percent when the thermal conductivity is less than about 9 W/cm°K. The deposition parameters to be modified include at least one parameter selected from the group consisting of the ratio of feedstock gases for chemical vapor deposition and the deposition temperature.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In accordance with a further form of the invention, a method is set forth for inspecting synthetic diamond to be utilized as a wear surface to select synthetic diamond that is expected to have superior wear properties. In accordance with this method, synthetic diamond having an equivalent strain of greater than a predetermined percentage is selected for use in certain wear<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> application(s), whereas the synthetic diamond that does not meet the predetermined criteria (as described above) can be used for applications where the superior wear properties are not required, such as in lower cost wear components.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Further features and advantages of the invention will become more readily apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of a plasma jet deposition system of a type which can be utilized in practicing an embodiment of the invention.</li><li>Fig. 2 is a top view of a wear component of a type typically utilized as an insert for a milling machine cutting tool.</li><li>Fig. 3 is a side view of the wear component of Fig. 2.</li><li>Fig. 4 is an operational flow diagram of a procedure in accordance with an embodiment of the invention for producing synthetic diamond having improved wear characteristics.</li><li>Fig. 5 is an operational flow diagram of a procedure of the invention for selecting synthetic diamond based on suitability for wear applications.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Referring to Fig. 1, there is shown a diagram of a plasma jet deposition system 200 of a type which can be utilized in practicing an embodiment of the invention. Reference can also be made to U.S. Patent No.s 4,471,003 and 4,487,162. The system 200 is contained within a vacuum housing 211 and includes an arc-forming section 215 which comprises a cylindrical anode 291, a rod-like cathode 292, and an injector 295 mounted adjacent the cathode so as to permit injected fluid to pass over the cathode 292. In the illustrated system the input fluid may be a mixture of hydrogen and methane. The anode 291 and cathode 292 are energized by a source of electric potential (not shown), for example a DC potential. Cylindrical magnets, designated by reference numeral 217, are utilized to control the plasma generated at the arc forming section. The magnets maintain the plasma within a narrow column until the plasma reaches the deposition region 60. Cooling coils 234, in which liquid nitrogen can be circulated, are located within the magnets and surround the focused plasma.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In operation, a mixture of hydrogen and methane is fed to the injector 295, and a plasma is obtained in front of the arc forming section and accelerated and focused toward the deposition region. The temperature and pressure at the plasma formation region are typically in the approximate ranges 1500-2700 °C<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> and 133-931 mbar (100-700 torr), respectively, and in the deposition region are in the approximate ranges 800-1100°C and 13.3-266 mbar (10-200 torr), respectively. As is known in the art, synthetic polycrystalline diamond can be formed from the described plasma, as the carbon in the methane is selectively deposited as diamond, and the graphite which forms is dissipated by combination with the hydrogen facilitating gas.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The bottom portion 105A of the chamber has a base 106 that can mount a medium 62 on which the synthetic diamond is to be deposited. The base can include a temperature controller. The medium 62 may be, for example, the base of a tool, an insert for a tool, the base of a bearing surface, etc. Alternatively, the medium 62 can be a substrate, such as molybdenum or graphite, on which synthetic diamond can be deposited, removed, and applied to a base to form a wear surface, such as for a tool or bearing or other wear component.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Figs. 2 and 3 illustrate an example of a wear component 20 of a type typically utilized as an insert for a milling machine. A tungsten carbide element or body 24 is provided in a generally rectangular shape with a chamfered corner having a depression 26 that receives a piece of diamond 28 that serves as a cutter. As is known in the art, the diamond 28 can be synthetic polycrystalline diamond film. The diamond can be deposited directly on the element 24 or, more typically for diamond thick films, a piece of synthetic diamond film that is mounted, such as<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> by brazing, on the element 24.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">In accordance with the improvement of a form of the present invention, the diamond wear surface comprises a polycrystalline synthetic diamond thick film (i.e. a film at least 20 µm thick) having an equivalent strain of at least 0.08 percent. For thick film synthetic diamond wear surfaces having a thermal conductivity greater than about 9 W/cm°K the equivalent strain should be at least about 0.08 percent to obtain superior wear characteristics. When the thermal conductivity is less than about 9 W/cm°K, an equivalent strain of at least about 0.10 percent is needed to provide the desired superior wear characteristics. The relationship between equivalent strain and wear properties is particularly significant at substantial thick film thicknesses, viz. greater than about 200 µm.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">As is known in the art, certain operating parameters of the plasma jet deposition equipment, or of other chemical vapor deposition equipments, are generally adjustable, such as by varying the ratio of feedstock gasses [for example, the relative percentages of hydrogen and methane], varying the temperature, and/or varying the pressure of the plasma and/or the target (e.g. the medium 62 in Fig. 1). In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, operating conditions are adjusted to obtain the desired minimum equivalent strain percentage. Increasing the deposition temperature tends to increase equivalent strain.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">In an embodiment hereof, equivalent strain is measured as<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> follows: X-ray diffraction measurements are made using Cu Ka radiation (45kV, 40mA on the tube) on a Philips PW1700 X-ray diffraction analyzer machine. The patterns are recorded for the diamond as grown (i.e. without crushing). The angle 2θ is scanned in 0.04 degree steps, dwelling 1 second at each step. Data are corrected in a standard manner using the Philips program provided for the user of the machine. In particular, a correction using the Lorentz polarization factor is made and the Ka2 peaks are stripped assuming the Ka2/Ka1 ratio is 0.5. Instrument broadening is estimated using 5-10 µm diamond powder as a standard. Finally, the integral breadth d of the 331 reflection is measured and the equivalent strain e computed from it assuming all of the broadening is induced by strain, using the formula<maths id="math0001" num=""><math display="block"><mrow><mtext>d = (e/4)tanθ</mtext></mrow></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="24" he="5" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> where θ is the usual diffraction angle, that is, 70.2 degrees for the 331 reflection. [See H.P. Klug, L.A. Alexander "X-ray Diffraction Procedures for Polycrystalline and Amorphous Materials", p661, Wiley-Interscience, New York, 1974.] The technique of measurement of equivalent strain is not, of itself, an inventive feature hereof, and it will be understood that any suitable technique for determining equivalent strain can be used, consistent with the principles of the invention.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">It is known that an increase in the thermal conductivity can be achieved in CVD diamond by varying the chemistry of the<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> depositing gas. For example, additions of oxygen and reductions in carbon content are both known methods of increasing thermal conductivity of CVD diamond. Thermal conductivity in an embodiment hereof is measured by a method described in Enguhard et al, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Volume B5, pp. 127-134 (1990).</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Fig. 4 is an operational flow diagram of a procedure in accordance with an embodiment of the invention for producing synthetic diamond having improved wear characteristics. The block 410 represents the initializing of deposition operating parameters, for example the operating parameters of the Fig. 1 arc jet plasma deposition equipment. These parameters may include, inter alia, the ratio of feedstock gases, the control of temperature, and the control of pressure. The block 420 represents the deposition of synthetic diamond, and the block 430 represents the measurement of the equivalent strain of the synthetic diamond. The thermal conductivity of the synthetic diamond can also be measured, as represented by the block 440. If the measured equivalent strain percentage is below a predetermined threshold (which, as noted above, may also take into account the thermal conductivity), a decision is made (represented by decision block 450) to modify the deposition parameters. For example, the deposition temperature can be raised, which tends to increase the equivalent strain of the resultant CVD diamond. Also, the percentage of methane in the<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> feedstock gases can be increased, if necessary, to increase the thermal conductivity of the resultant CVD diamond. When the equivalent strain is above the desired minimum, the process can be periodically monitored, as represented by re-entry to the block 420.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">In accordance with a further aspect of the invention, and as represented by the operational flow diagram of Fig. 5, measurement of equivalent strain is utilized in selecting diamond samples (or selecting batches or production runs from which samples are taken) for suitability in wear applications. Diamond samples (or runs or batches) which do not meet equivalent strain criteria can be used in applications where some compromise in wear properties may be acceptable, such as in lower cost wear components. The block 510 represents the production of thick film polycrystalline diamond. The block 520 represents the performance of testing for equivalent strain on a sample of the produced polycrystalline synthetic diamond. Thermal conductivity can also be measured, as represented by block 530. If the measured equivalent strain percentage is above a predetermined threshold (which, as noted above, may also take into account the thermal conductivity), the diamond can be accepted for a particular wear surface application or, conversely, rejected for such application (decision block 540).<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --></p><heading id="h0001"><u>EXAMPLES</u></heading><p id="p0029" num="0029">Equipment of the type shown in Fig. 1, but without cooling coils, was utilized to produce synthetic diamond samples that were subjected to a number of wear tests.

EP	0604687	B1	2000-04-19	en	DESCR	1	<heading id="h0001">A. <u>Background of the invention</u></heading><heading id="h0002">1. Field of the invention</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The invention is in the field of pattern recognition. It relates to a system for recognising characters, such as digits and letters, both in handwritten and printed form, and more particularly to a method for deriving features of a character to be recognised in a character recognition system of this type.</p><heading id="h0003">2. Prior art</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Character recognition systems such as those indicated above usually comprise a number of process steps which are described below with reference to a block diagram shown in Fig. 1. Said process steps are:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>(1) optical scanning of a character on the surface of a carrier; such scanning, for example with a video camera, results in a two-dimensional pixel pattern, for example 64 × 64 pixels, to which a grey value encoded in 5 bits is appended;</li><li>(2) binary quantisation of the pixel pattern, by subjecting the grey values of all the pixels to a threshold operation, the result, which can be seen as a black/white pattern or a pattern of "zeros" and "ones", being stored in a memory;</li><li>(3) deriving, from said quantised pixel pattern, an image description of the character to be recognised;</li><li>(4) deriving, from the image description, a set of character features of the character to be recognised;</li><li>(5) checking the set of character features found against results obtained previously with the aid of learning processes on known characters;<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></li><li>(6) deciding, on the basis of the check, which known character the character to be recognised is recognised as.</li></ul></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A recognition technique of this type is known, for example, from reference [1] (cf. under C.). In this technique the quantised pixel pattern is used to derive a contour description. As a contour of a digitised pattern of a feature to be recognised is followed, the coordinates of certain points are selected. Those points are selected whose inner product of the point vector corresponding to each point and a directional vector in a number of predefined directions has the highest value. A selected point is characterised as an "extreme point" if the difference between said inner product at that point and the inner product at the following selected point exceeds a previously established limit value. Said extreme points define a polygonal approximation of the contour of the pattern. Said polygon shows a pattern of convex and concave structures. Said pattern is used for comparison with similar patterns, which are characteristic of known characters and stored in a previously compiled "dictionary". The character to be recognised is read as that known character whose patterns show the best correspondence.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A limitation of the pattern features derived in said known recognition technique is its being based on a structural description of the patterns to be recognised. This, however, produces acceptable recognition results only if the patterns to be recognised have a clear structure. This means that said known technique can be sensibly applied only for the recognition of characters from clear handwriting or typing. Another limitation is the variability of the number of features on which the recognition is based, i.e. the number of convex and concave structures in the pattern. This makes it difficult to apply deciders in the recognition, which work with a fixed number of features, such as, for example, those which make use of standard "feed-forward" neural<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> networks.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Reference [2] discloses another character recognition system of the above mentioned type. The recognition technique, on which this system is based, derives character features from a number of so-called views of an image, either the complete image or parts thereof, of a binary quantised pixel pattern of a character to be recognised. In this so-called views method, a number of different features of the pixel pattern is derived for each view, from above, from below and from the side, and for each image or part image. For these features, such as jumps, slopes, endpoints and islands, feature values are determined for specific patterns found in the views. During the check phase, the feature values found are weighted using adjustable weighting factors for each class of characters to be recognised. Said weighting factors have been obtained previously from a learning process on known characters. The weighted feature values are used to determine a score for each class. The character to be recognised is recognised as that character which belongs to the class in which the highest score has been determined.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">This known technique, using the views method for deriving character features, has been developed in the first instance for recognising digits. The character features which are derived in this process have been found to be too general for acceptable letter recognition. Moreover, because of the many different features for which a character to be recognised has to be checked, the method for deriving the features is rather complex. Because of the type of the features, which are in fact structural features, a recognition based on said features is furthermore sensitive to breaks in an image pattern of a character to be recognised, and this recognition method is therefore unsuitable for, for example, matrix writing, such as, in particular, letters printed by a matrix printer.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In digital picture processing it is also known to make use of distance functions. Methods based thereon are sometimes denoted as "distance transform" or "distance mapping". A known "distance mapping" method of this type is, for example, disclosed by reference [3]. This involves appending to each pixel, which may form part of a subset of pixels, in the object (or in the background) of the original binary image, the shortest distance to the nearest pixel in the background (or the object). Corresponding to each point there is thus a distance tag. Further processing is then carried out on the basis of this two-component description, in which processing, inter alia, skeleton structures of the character to be recognised being traced. A distance tag of this type is inadequate per se as a character feature for the purpose of, in particular, recognising handwritten characters.</p><heading id="h0004">B. <u>Summary of the invention</u></heading><p id="p0008" num="0008">The object of the invention is to provide a method for deriving character features in a character recognition system, and a character recognition system in which this method is applied, which method and system do not have the above mentioned drawbacks and limitations. According to the invention, a method for deriving character features in a character recognition system for recognising characters, such as letters and digits, which comprises a step of deriving for each point of a plurality of points in an image plane of image points including a pattern of a character to be recognised feature data indicative of the distance to a nearest boundary point of the pattern, and which is known from reference [3], is, to this end, characterised according to Claim 1. An underlying idea in this context is that generally for such a reference point R<sub>i</sub> a nearest boundary point corresponds to a unique point of the image description of the character to be recognised, including its surroundings. By then considering the surroundings of such a unique point corresponding to a reference point R<sub>i</sub>, it is possible to select, in addition to the distance data D(R<sub>i</sub>), yet one or more additional features which may characterise the outline of the image description of the character in the vicinity of such a reference point. It was found that a very strong feature for this purpose is the feature which provides an estimate of the direction H(R<sub>i</sub>), which, if the image description of the character contains a contour description, has a contour in a unique<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> contour point corresponding to the reference point R<sub>i</sub>. Indeed, in a preferred embodiment the method according to the invention is characterised according to Claim 2.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Compared with the views method described above, the method according to the invention bases the recognition on a number of features which have been obtained, as it were, from local views of a character pattern, as seen from each of the reference points.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Reference [5] discloses a method for deriving features for the purpose of gray-level image recognition, in which features are determined in so called feature cells of which the locations for matching purposes are described by means of polar coordinates relative to an origin, called reference cell. The derived features are much more complicated than the features derived by the method of the present invention.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">According to the invention, a character recognition system of a type indicated in the precharacterising clause of Claim 7 and which is known from reference [1] or [2], is, to this end, characterised as in Claim 7.</p><heading id="h0005">C. <u>References</u></heading><p id="p0012" num="0012"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>[1] United States Patent document number 4,566,124, entitled "Pattern reading system";</li><li>[2] United States Patent document number 3,999,161, entitled "Method and device for the recognition of characters preferably of figures";</li><li>[3] P.-E.

Starting from a description of a character to be recognised, the recognition proceeds on the basis of a number of features, derived within suitably determined boundary points, of the described character. The invention therefore relates, in the first instance, to process step (4) in the character recognition system described with<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> reference to Fig. 1. The invention can be applied both to a pixel description and to a contour description of a character to be recognised. This relates to process step (3). Since a contour approach is preferred, it will be described in detail hereinafter, while the pixel approach will only be hinted at. The process steps (1) and (2) are carried out according to known techniques by recording means which are known per se and are therefore not described in further detail here. In the further description of an illustrative embodiment it is assumed that these steps have taken place and that a black/white pixel pattern of a character to be recognised has been stored in a two-dimensional image memory and is accessible for further operations. Such a black/white pixel pattern in an image plane comprising LxM pixels has an elementary description, called the pixel description, by means of a function B(i,j), of pixel values for each pixel (i,j) in the image plane, where i=1,--,L, and j=1,--,M, which function is defined by B(i,j)=1 for each black pixel (i,j) and B(i,j)=0 for each white pixel (i,j) in the image plane.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">It is further assumed that, if the character to be recognised is part of a row of simultaneously recorded characters, a segmentation operation has already been carried out on said row, according to techniques known per se, in order to separate the characters and make them suitable for separate treatment. The process steps (5) and (6) are also carried out by known techniques. Since, however, the checking and decision means required there-for must previously have been learnt, so that certain characters may be recognised on the basis of the character features derived according to the method according to the invention, such means will be briefly explained in more detail following a full description of the method.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In the field of image processing and pattern recognition, the so-called distance transform is known. This transform appends a number D(P) to each<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> point P in an image plane of a black-and-white pattern of image points, in the following way:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="dash" compact="compact"><li>if the point P is situated in a white area of the image plane, then D(P) is equal to the distance to the nearest black image point; and</li><li>if the point P is situated in a black area which, for example, represents a digit or a letter, then D(P) is equal to the distance to the nearest white image point, provided with a minus sign.</li></ul></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">This distance transform is often used in so-called skeleton algorithms for tracing skeleton structures, the character recognition then being carried out on the basis of the skeleton structures found. An image signal thus transformed is also sometimes used directly for the purpose of the recognition process. A distance tag is then used as a character feature. If a limited number of image points is included in the process, for example to speed up the arithmetic operation, the distance tag is insufficient for describing a character to be recognised. To achieve an acceptable recognition probability, very large numbers, if not all, of the image points are therefore included in the transform. Nevertheless, the recognition of, in particular, handwriting is insufficient. The object of the invention, however, is to achieve a considerably higher recognition probability by appending one or more additional character features to each distance tag obtained on the basis of a distance transform on a limited number N of points R<sub>i</sub>, which have been preselected in a suitable way (where i=1,2,--,N), and which are called reference points, in the image plane.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">This is based on the idea that, if such a reference point R<sub>i</sub> has a distance tag D(R<sub>i</sub>) appended to it, in general a unique boundary point P<sub>i</sub> of a character to be recognised will correspond thereto, including its surroundings. Boundary points are to be understood as those image points which have both white and black image points in their direct surroundings. In the case of a contour<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> description, a boundary point is a point on the contour, a contour point. Unless stated otherwise, from now on, a contour description and contour points will be assumed. By then considering the surroundings of a unique contour point P<sub>i</sub> of this type and corresponding to a reference point R<sub>i</sub>, it is possible to append, to the distance tag D(R<sub>i</sub>), one or more additional features, which, seen from such a reference point R<sub>i</sub>, describe the outline of the nearest contour segment C(R<sub>i</sub>). It was found that a very strong feature therefor is the feature which provides an estimate of the direction H(R<sub>i</sub>) of the contour in the contour point P<sub>i</sub>. Other supplementary features to be named, also those which provide an estimate of the second and third derivative of the contour in the contour point P<sub>i</sub>. Said supplementary features, however, do not provide much of an additional contribution to increasing the recognition probability of a character. All these descriptions, on the basis of said additional features, of the said nearest contour segments C(R<sub>i</sub>) for all the N reference points R<sub>i</sub> together are found to enable very effective recognition if N is sufficiently large. From 70 to 120 reference points are preferably used for each character, which points may be distributed regularly or randomly over the image plane.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In an example given below, the method for determining the features D(R<sub>i</sub>) and H(R<sub>i</sub>) for a reference point R<sub>i</sub> in the image plane of a pattern to be recognised will be explained in more detail.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">For this purpose, Fig. 2 shows a black-and-white pattern of a separate character in a rectangle of 12 fields by 16, each field corresponding to a pixel. For the sake of clarity, the number of pixels in this example has been kept small. Each field is uniquely identifiable by means of its centre coordinates (i,j), where i=1,--,12 and j=1,--,16. The black fields are hatched. Each field is black or white. Thus field (2,3) is white and field (4,3) is black. If a field (i,j) is black, then it has a pixel value B(i,j)=1; and, if it is white, then it has the<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> pixel value B(i,j)=0. Where a black field adjoins a white field, the boundary lines are drawn as bold lines. Said two-dimensional description is then converted, by means of a process which is called contour tracer, into a one-dimensional contour description of the pattern of the character to be recognised. Said contour tracer successively runs through all the 12 × 16 fields of the pixel image wile looking for contour points. Each time a starting point is found, a contour is generated. In this process, the contours are given a number, and their relative position is established by remembering whether a starting point found is situated within a previously determined contour. The process of tracing a contour is now explained in more detail with reference to Fig. 3 with sections 3a and 3b. In this process, each pixel is regarded as a black or white small square of finite dimensions. The corners of such a square are called grid points. In Fig. 3a, a single black pixel having centre coordinates (i,j) is shown as a hatched small square, with numbered grid points 1 to 4 inclusive. A separate black pixel by itself already has a well-defined contour, which is formed by the boldly drawn periphery segments from 1 to 2, from 2 to 3, etc., which encloses the black area in a clockwise direction (according to the direction of the arrow). The x,y coordinates of said four contour grid points 1 to 4 inclusive are chosen as:<maths id="math0001" num=""><math display="block"><mrow><mtable><mtr><mtd><mrow><mtable><mtr><mtd><mrow><mtext>(x(1),y(1)) = (i-0.5,j+0.5)</mtext></mrow></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mrow><mtext>(x(2),y(2)) = (i+0.5,j+0.5)</mtext></mrow></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mrow><mtext>(x(3),y(3)) = (i+0.5,j-0.5)</mtext></mrow></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mrow><mtext>(x(4),y(4)) = (i-0.5,j-0.5)</mtext></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable></mrow></math><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="52" he="26" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In Fig. 3b the situation is shown where, when tracing a contour C after the (k-2)th and the (k-1)th contour grid point, when coming from an arrival direction v, a grid point (x(k),y(k)) has been found as the kth contour point.

A first starting point for a contour is found if, during this scan, the first black pixel, in the example pixel (6,14), is found. The first two contour points selected in this case are those corresponding to contour grid points 1 and 2 in Fig. 3a, with v = (1,0) as arrival direction in the second contour grid point. The contour tracing algorithm is then started until a return is made to the first contour<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> grid point. For each new start of the contour tracing algorithm, a contour number CN is increased by one. During each execution of the contour tracing algorithm, the pixels which belong to the same contour are marked with the same contour number CN. This marking is remembered in a separate, second image memory. Prior to the commencement of scanning of the image plane, all the pixels in the second image memory have the same initial mark, for example zero. After completion of a contour, the pixel image is scanned further in the search for a starting point for a next contour. The next starting point is found if, during further scanning, a black pixel is found which has not yet been marked, or if an unmarked white pixel is found within a previously found contour. In such a case the tracing algorithm is again run through. During the run-through, all the contour grid points found are recorded, in the order found, in a contour table, including an associated contour account. Said account comprises, for each contour, the number CN of the contour, pointers nrept and nrlpt to the first and last contour grid point of the contour in question, respectively, and a code cdoc which indicates the number of the immediately surrounding contour. The periphery of the whole pixel image is considered, in this context, as a virtual contour having the number 0. The pixel image of Fig. 2 has a first contour C1, whose contour grid points are successively numbered 1, 2, 3, --, 61 and 62. It has a second contour C2, whose contour grid points are numbered 63, 64, --, 77 and 78, and which is entirely situated within the first contour C1. The associated contour table is shown in Table 1 with subsections 1a and 1b, the contour account being incorporated in subsection 1a, and Table 1b forming the list of contour grid points.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">By way of example, assume a set RP of reference points RP(m,n), comprising a number of pixel centres:<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --><maths id="math0004" num=""><math display="block"><mrow><mtext>RP = {RP(m,n) = (4m-2,5n-2)|m,n = 1,2,3}</mtext></mrow></math><img id="ib0004" file="imgb0004.tif" wi="79" he="5" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">One of said reference points, RP(3,2), has been drawn in Fig. 2. If, from such a point, the local shape of the closest contour segment, in this case of contour C1, is investigated, features are obtained of a rather angular and busy pattern. Therefore, prior to commencing the feature derivation proper, the contour description obtained by the above contour tracing algorithm is first supplied to what can be called a contour filtering process, which produces a contour with a quieter outline. This is carried out, again by way of example, with a simple linear filter which, running along the contour, always determines a weighted mean of the corresponding contour grid points. In this process, the filtering step is always carried out with an offset of one grid spacing. The result of this filtering is a new, equally long list of contour points, which are usually no longer grid points, and which form the corners of a polygon with a quiet outline. If the length of such a linear filter is chosen to be four grid units, each filtering step always involves five successive contour grid points from the contour table.

The contour account in this case has remained unchanged.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> It is the case that the contour description is more suitable for the derivation proper of local contour features D and H for each of the reference points of the set RP. In this process, each contour is regarded as being composed of chords. A chord, with the number k, is the straight connection line segment between two successive numbered contour points k-1 and k, including the contour point k as the end point, and excluding the contour point k-1 as the starting point. The list of contour points in the contour table thus becomes a list of end points of successive chords which constitute the contours specified in the contour account. It is then determined, for each reference point from the set RP, which of the chords of all the contours in the contour table the reference point Dmin(RQ) is at the shortest distance from as well as said shortest distance itself. This is achieved by running successively through the list of end points of the chords. Depending on the position of a reference point RQ with regard to a chord k, three different situations may arise. These are shown diagrammatically in Fig. 5 with subsections 5a, 5b and 5c. In the situation according to Fig. 5a, the most closely situated point is in fact the starting point of the chord k. The minimum distance Dmin(RQ) found so far has therefore already been determined in the case of a preceding chord. In the situations according to Figs 5b and 5c, respectively, a point P of the chord k and the end point of the chord k are the nearest points which are at a distance d from the reference point RQ. In both cases a test is then carried out to discover whether this distance d found is shorter than the minimum distance Dmin(RQ) previously recorded so far. If so, the distance d found is recorded as the new value for Dmin(RQ), together with the associated chord number.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The following formulae are used for calculating the distance: in the situation according to Fig. 5b:<maths id="math0006" num=""><math display="block"><mrow><msup><mrow><mtext>d</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>2</mtext></mrow></msup><msup><mrow><mtext> = (ax * cy - ay * cx)</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>2</mtext></mrow></msup><msup><mrow><mtext>/(cx</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>2</mtext></mrow></msup><msup><mrow><mtext> +cy</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>2</mtext></mrow></msup><mtext>)</mtext></mrow></math><img id="ib0006" file="imgb0006.tif" wi="69" he="6" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths><!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> and in the situation according to Fig. 5c:<maths id="math0007" num=""><math display="block"><mrow><msup><mrow><mtext>d</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>2</mtext></mrow></msup><msup><mrow><mtext> = ax</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>2</mtext></mrow></msup><msup><mrow><mtext> + ay</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>2</mtext></mrow></msup></mrow></math><img id="ib0007" file="imgb0007.tif" wi="29" he="6" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> in which:<maths id="math0008" num=""><math display="block"><mrow><mtable><mtr><mtd><mrow><mtable><mtr><mtd><mrow><mtext>ax = x(RQ) - X(k) and ay = y(RQ) - Y(k)</mtext></mrow></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mrow><mtext>cx = X(k) - X(k-1) and cy = Y(k) - Y(k-1)</mtext></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable></mrow></math><img id="ib0008" file="imgb0008.tif" wi="88" he="14" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths></p><p id="p0029" num="0029">In fact, the minimum d<sup>2</sup> is first determined, and only if this has been found is its root calculated. At the same time, the process checks whether the reference point RQ in question is located to the left or the right of the contour of which the chord with the minimum distance Dmin(RQ) forms part. This is done by determining the inner product (ax * cy - ay * cx) of the vector (cy,cx) perpendicular to the chord, which is now interpreted as a vector (cx,cy), with the vector (ax,ay) defined by the end point of the chord and the reference point RQ. If the value of the inner product is positive, the reference point RQ is located to the right and, if negative, to the left of the contour.

In the distribution step T each presented value v<sub>n</sub> is, as it were, distributed by distribution units t<sub>n</sub>(n=1,--,2N) by presenting the same value in a multiple way, viz. in M directions, i.e. as many as there are perceptrons. During the weigthing step W each feature value v<sub>n</sub> in each direction m is weighted by means of a weighting factor W<sub>nm</sub> from a set of weighting factors {W<sub>nm</sub>}. This set of weighting factors in fact forms a dimensional array, the weighting factor matrix, where n=1,--,2N is the number of a presented feature value v<sub>n</sub>, and m=1,--,M is the number of a character to be recognised in the set of characters to be recognised. With the aid of the weighting factors, a score is then determined in the summation step Σ by each one of a number M of summators σ<sub>m</sub>, which score forms the previously mentioned coefficient s<sub>m</sub> of the score vector S. For each summator σ<sub>m</sub>, this score is:<maths id="math0017" num=""><math display="block"><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>s</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>m</mtext></mrow></msub><msub><mrow><mtext>=f(Σw</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>nm</mtext></mrow></msub><msub><mrow><mtext>*v</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>n</mtext></mrow></msub><mtext>)</mtext></mrow></math><img id="ib0017" file="imgb0017.tif" wi="26" he="6" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> in which the summation is carried out over all n=1,--,2N and f represents a non-linear function such as a sigmoid. This is indicated in FIG. 7 by arrows from each distribution unit t<sub>n</sub> to each of the summators σ<sub>m</sub>. The arrows here are provided with their associated weighting factor from the weighting factor matrix.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The coefficients s<sub>m</sub> of the score vector S are presented to the maximum selector 102. The weighting factor matrix {w<sub>nm</sub>} is located in a memory accessible to the decider. The coefficients of this matrix have been predetermined according to a training algorithm which is known as the "back propagation containing algorithm" (see, for example, reference [4], particularly<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> Box 6.). In that case, character features were presented to the decider of known characters from a training set of known characters, which had been derived with the aid of the new method described above.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">When applied to a large test set of practice material (approximately 200,000) of readily separable handwritten digits, a character recognition system, which worked with the new method for deriving the character features "distance" and "direction", was found to satisfactorily recognise 99.3% of the characters presented. If only the character feature "distance" was used, the maximum yield was found to be 98.6%.<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> <tables id="tabl0001" num="0001"><table frame="all"><title>Table 1a</title><tgroup

EP	0600143	B1	2000-01-19	en	DESCR	1	<p id="p0001" num="0001">This invention relates to radiation monitors, and more specifically relates to an electromagnetic radiation monitor which may either be worn by persons who may be exposed to potentially harmful levels of electromagnetic energy or may be strategically positioned at a fixed location whereby persons will be alerted as to the presence of potentially harmful levels of electromagnetic radiation. Even more particularly, this invention relates to a personal or area (fixed position) electromagnetic radiation monitor which exhibits broadband frequency performance and polarization independence.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Attempts have been made to male an electromagnetic radiation monitor which may be worn by a person working in areas where potentially harmful electromagnetic radiation may be present or which may be strategically positioned at a fixed location to detect excess leakage of RF radiation and alert persons to the leakage. Early studies, such as those reported by Beischer in his article <u>Microwave Reflection, Diffraction and Transmission By Man</u>, Department of Naval Aerospace Medical Research Lab, Pensacola, Florida, June, 1973, have shown that scattering from a body may produce errors greater than 2dB. This scattering becomes more significant where broadband frequency performance and independence of polarization are desired monitor characteristics. To this date, no practical device having a broadband frequency response and being independent of polarization, to the knowledge of the inventor, has been successfully marketed.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">It is also known from document GB-A-803792 an apparatus for radio frequency measuring comprising a transmitter and a receiver located in a chamber. The transmitter is placed at the focus of a curved reflecting wall, and walls with wave-absorbing layers are placed along the lateral walls of the chamber so as to ensure that only the direct wave from the transmitter and the reflected waves from the curved reflecting wall can reach the receiver. The apparatus also presents a backing made of a graduated lossy material.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">It is also known from document GB-A-998779 a portable measuring instrument for detecting high frequency electromagnetic radiation. The device comprises circular housing having two two pairs of slot aerials of different lenghts so as to detect the presence of electromagnetic radiations over a wide frequency range.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A conducting surface may be placed behind the low frequency aerials to provide a capacitive shunt effect so as to reduce their response to high frequency components of radiation, and the device may be backed by material having an appreciable dielectric loss at the higher frequencies to reduce the response of the high frequency aerials at the lower frequencies, at which frequencies the lossy material will appear reactive.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It is an object of the present invention to provide an electromagnetic radiation monitor which may be worn by persons who may be exposed to potentially harmful levels of electromagnetic energy.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">It is another object of the present invention to provide an electromagnetic radiation monitor which exhibits broadband frequency performance and substantial independence of polarization.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">It is a further object of the present invention to provide an unobtrusive, pocket-size personal electromagnetic radiation monitor which accurately detects RF radiation and sends out a warning the moment it senses that the wearer moves into a danger zone.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is yet another object of the present invention to provide an electromagnetic radiation monitor that includes an audible and visual alarm which will indicate a need to leave an area promptly.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">It is still another object of the present invention to provide a personal electromagnetic radiation monitor which includes a dual battery system and a low battery warning when battery replacement is required.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a personal electromagnetic radiation monitor which includes structure that allows sensitive electronic circuitry contained in the monitor to operate correctly while effectively "surrounded" by high level RF radiation, thereby producing minimal false alarms within or outside of the monitor's specified frequency range.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a personal electromagnetic radiation monitor whose performance is substantially unaffected due to scattering when worn by a person.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide an area (fixed position) electromagnetic radiation monitor by which an area near a source of high<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> power RF or microwave energy can be monitored.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">It is still a further object of the present invention to provide an area (fixed position) electromagnetic radiation monitor which accurately detects RF or microwave energy within a broad frequency range independent of polarization and sends out a warning when irradiated by power exceeding a threshold amount.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">It is yet still a further object of the present invention to provide an area (fixed position) electromagnetic radiation monitor which includes an audio and visual alarm and includes structure that allows sensitive electronic circuitry contained in the monitor to operate correctly while irradiated.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">In accordance with the present invention as defined in Claim 1, a personal electromagnetic radiation monitor includes an electromagnetic radiation sensor, a backing of graduated lossy material and a conductive shield spaced apart from the sensor. The electromagnetic radiation sensor may include thin film resistive thermocouples. The radiation sensor is situated in proximity of the backing of graduated lossy material so that the backing is between the radiation sensor and one side of the conductive shield. The backing is progressively more conductive through its thickness from the front surface of the backing which faces the sensor to the back surface which faces the conductive shield. The radiation monitor also comprises an audible alarm transducer connected with the electromagnetic radiation sensor and an ear plug assembly in communication with the audible alarm transducer, the ear plug assembly being electrically non-conductive to prevent RF energy from being received by the assembly and radiated to the wearer's head.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the radiation sensor, backing of lossy material and conductive shield are all mounted in a housing of the monitor. On the inside of one of the housing sides is mounted an audible alarm transducer, which transducer is situated in alignment with an opening formed through the thickness of the housing side. A first hook and loop fastener patch is mounted on<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> the outside surface of the housing side and surrounding the opening.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Preferably, the monitor ear plug assembly has an elongated pneumatic tube having opposite ends, a pneumatic ear plug mounted on one end of the tube and a hollow housing defining an interior cavity mounted on the other end. The cavity housing has an opening formed through its thickness, and includes a second hook and loop fastener patch surrounding the opening. The second fastener patch is adapted to mate with the first fastener patch of the monitor housing to allow the cavity housing of the ear plug assembly to be mounted adjacent to the transducer. In this manner, the non-conductive ear plug assembly may be quickly and easily secured to the monitor housing so that the wearer of the monitor may use the ear plug assembly in high noise environments.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">In accordance with another preferred embodiment, the monitor includes an alarm circuit and a dual battery system, and a low battery sensor. When a low battery voltage is detected on one battery, the audible alarm transducer will chirp at a predetermined interval. At an extremely low battery level, the audible alarm will emit a continuous tone. The second battery is used substantially independently of the first battery to illuminate a warning light in dangerous radiation environments. If the warning light circuit fails, the audible alarm circuit will continue to function.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In a further preferred embodiment, the sensitive electronic circuitry of the monitor is protected from high level RF radiation by including a second section of graduated lossy material situated in the housing and at least partially surrounding the batteries of the monitor. In this way, RF energy<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> entering the monitor will be absorbed by this second section before it is "picked up" by the battery leads between the circuitry and the battery.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In accordance with a further embodiment, an area electromagnetic radiation monitor is provided. The area electromagnetic radiation monitor includes a radiation sensor proximately situated to a backing of graduated lossy material, a sensor and an extruded, non-conductive housing structure which is affixed to a conductive shield and encases the radiation sensor and graduated lossy material.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In accordance with another preferred solution, the backing of graduated lossy material comprises a laminate formed from at least first, second and third layers of lossy material having different resistivities, wherein the first layer is more resistive than the second layer and wherein the second layer is more resistive than the third layer. The third layer being positioned closest to the conductive shield and the first layer being tapered so as to minimize field distortion.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments thereof, which is to be read in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="dash" compact="compact"><li>Fig. 1 is a front perspective view of a personal electromagnetic radiation monitor formed in accordance with the present invention;</li><li>Fig. 2 is a rear perspective view of the radiation monitor of the present invention;</li><li>Fig. 3 is an exploded view, in perspective, of a portion of the monitor shown in Fig. 1;</li><li>Fig. 4 is a front view of a preferred form of a radiation sensor for use in the monitor of the present<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> invention;</li><li>Fig. 5 is a cross-sectional view of an ear plug assembly for use with the monitor of the present invention;</li><li>Fig. 6 is a graph illustrating the performance of the radiation monitor of the present invention over frequency in free space and when worn by a user;</li><li>Fig. 7 is a preferred form of an electronic circuit used in conjunction with the monitor of the present invention;</li><li>Fig. 8 is an elevated perspective view of an area electromagnetic radiation monitor formed in accordance with a second form of the present invention;</li><li>Fig. 9 is a cross-sectional view of the area electromagnetic radiation monitor shown in Figure 8.</li></ul></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">A first embodiment of the electromagnetic radiation monitor of the present invention is shown in Figs. 1 and 2 of the drawings, it will be seen that a personal electromagnetic radiation monitor constructed in accordance with one form of the present invention includes a two piece housing 2. Mounted on the inside surface of the front wall 4 of the two piece housing is an audible alarm transducer 6 (see Fig. 3), such as a piezo ceramic transducer, which, as will be explained, provides a warning of high level RF radiation or that the battery used in the monitor is at a low voltage. During an initial turn-on test, the audible alarm 6 preferably provides a one second burst. Above a preset threshold of the detected RF energy, the alarm provides a periodic nominal one second burns with the repetition rate increasing with the level of exposure. When the monitor battery is at a low voltage, the alarm 6 provides an audible chirp every forty seconds to a continuous warble (as the battery voltage drops). If the battery voltage is so low that the electromagnetic radiation sensor used in the monitor fails, the audible alarm provides a continuous tone.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The personal electromagnetic radiation monitor of the present invention further includes a visual display in the form of a light emitting diode (LED) 8. The LED 8 is mounted on the upper wall 10 of the mated housing. During an initial turn-on test, the circuitry included in the monitor will illuminate the LED 8. When a predetermined amount of RF energy is detected by the monitor, the electronic circuitry will cause the LED 8 to light and the audible alarm 6 to beep, indicating a need for the wearer of the monitor to leave the area promptly.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The monitor further includes an on/off switch 12 mounted on a side wall 14 of the mated housing, as well as a resilient clip 16 mounted on the back wall 18 of the housing to allow the monitor to be carried by the wearer on his belt or shirt pocket.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The radiation monitor of the present invention also includes an ear plug assembly 20 so that the monitor may be used in high noise environments. As shown in Figs 1 and 5 of the drawings, a Velcro (TM) hook and loop fastener patch 22 is mounted on the outside surface of the housing wall 4 on which the transducer 6 is mounted and situated to surround an opening 23 formed in the wall and aligned with the transducer. The ear plug assembly 20 includes an elongated hollow tube 24. A pneumatic ear piece or ear plug 26 is mounted on one end of the tube 24, and a hollow housing 28 defining an interior cavity 30 is mounted on the other end. The cavity housing 28 has an opening 32 formed through its thickness, and includes a second hook and loop fastener patch 34 surrounding the opening 32 which is adapted to mate with the first hook and loop fastener patch 22 of the monitor housing. This will allow the cavity housing 28 to be mounted adjacent to the transducer 6 so that the tone emitted by the transducer will be carried by air pressure through the tube to the pneumatic ear plug<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> 26.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">One advantage of the ear plug assembly 20 of the present invention is that it is completely electrically non-conductive. Thus, the ear plug assembly will not pick up RF energy which might have otherwise affected the electronic circuitry of the monitor, as a conventional electrical transducer would, and further provides a safety feature in that the user of the monitor does not wear an electrically conductive device on his head, to prevent electrical shock and to prevent RF energy from being picked up by the ear plug assembly and being radiated to the wearer's head. The mating Velcro (TM) hook and loop fastener patches 34, 22 on the ear plug assembly and the monitor housing allow the ear plug assembly to be quickly and easily connected non-electrically to the radiation monitor.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Referring now to Fig. 3 of the drawings, it will be seen that a preferred form of the personal electromagnetic radiation monitor of the present invention includes a first housing half 36 on which is mounted the transducer 6, as mentioned previously, and a second housing half 38 which includes a battery compartment 40, and on which is mounted the on/off switch 12. Sandwiched between the housing halves is an electromagnetic radiation sensor 44, a backing of graduated lossy material 46, a conductive shield 48 which acts as a back or ground plane, and a printed circuit board 50 containing the electronic circuitry for the monitor.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The electromagnetic radiation sensor 44 preferably includes thin film resistive thermocouples. In one form of the present invention, the electromagnetic radiation sensor includes a pair of mutually orthogonally disposed antenna elements 52 residing coplanarly to each other, but more preferably includes four interconnected antenna elements 52, adjacent antenna elements being at right<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> angles to each other, all four antenna elements 52 residing in the same plane, as shown in Fig. 4. Each antenna element 52 extends along a respective longitudinal axis, and includes an array of the thin film resistive thermocouples 54 arranged along the axis, and a plurality of spaced apart conductive elements 56 of discrete length arranged transversely to the axis of the array. Each thermocouple 54 of each antenna element is disposed between adjacent conductive elements 56. The antenna arrangement used in the radiation monitor of the present invention is very similar to that disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4.518.912.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The thin film elements function as both antenna and detector. Preferably, the hot and cold junctions of the thermocouples are separated by only a 0,5 millimetre, thereby eliminating offsets due to changes in ambient temperature, either spatial or temporal. The use of the thin film resistive thermocouples 54 in the particular arrangement described above provides broadband, true RMS detection of electromagnetic energy.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The electromagnetic radiation sensor 44 is mounted against a thin Mylar (TM), or more preferably, Kapton (TM) spacer sheet 58. The spacer 58 is preferably about 0,0127 centimetres in thickness, and is provided to prevent shorting of the sensor on the lossy material backing 46.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The lossy material backing 46 is graduated in resistivity. More specifically, the backing includes a front surface 60 facing the sensor 44 and an opposite back surface 62 facing the conductive shield 48. The backing is progressively more conductive through its thickness from the front surface 60 to the back surface 62. In one form of the invention, the backing may be a laminate or sandwich of two or more layers of lossy<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> material having different resistivities, as shown in Fig. 3. Alternatively, the backing may be formed from a lossy material which is continuously more conductive through its thickness from the front surface to the back surface.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">When a backing of a laminate of two layers of lossy material is used, the first layer 64 closest to the sensor is preferably a 0,635 centimetres thick high resistivity material, and the second layer 66 closest to the conductive shield is preferably a 0,635 centimetres thick low resistivity material. The first layer 64 preferably has a resistivity of about 15kΩ (kilo ohms) per cubic centimetre, and has a surface resistivity of approximately 20.000 ohms per square centimetre. The second layer 66 has a lower resistivity of approximately 600 ohms per cubic centimetre, and has a surface resistivity of approximately 2.000 ohms per square centimetre.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The higher resistivity surface of the lossy material backing is positioned to face the radiation sensor 44, while the lower resistance surface of the backing is positioned to face the conductive shield plate 48 such that the resistive material becomes progressively more conductive as the electric field penetrates deeper into the backing. Thus, the lossy material backing is terminated with the substantially totally reflective plate 48. The conductive shield plate 48 also provides some of the shielding for the electronic circuitry of the monitor.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The distributed resistance of the sensor 44, in combination with the sensor's being mounted on the lossy material backing 46 which gradually decreases in resistivity towards the conductive shield plate, provides broadband operation. The resistance of the sensor being large relative to the antenna reactance<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> maintains a constant sensitivity with frequency over the operating band.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Fig. 6 compares the variation in the threshold which will sound the monitor alarm over the operating frequency, which is preferably between 2 Gigahertz and 18 Gigahertz when the monitor is worn by a user and when it is standing in free space. It is evident from the graph shown in Fig. 6 that the broadband personal monitor of the present invention is made essentially independent of its operative environment. The scattering from the wearer's body has little affect on the performance of the monitor. As essentially flat frequency response with less than ± 1,5 dB variation and an independence of field perturbation due to scattering from the subject's body results from the utilization in the monitor of the thin film resistive thermocouple elements 54 mounted adjacent the graduated lossy material backing 46 which itself is backed with the conductive shield plate 48. The difference in response from when the monitor is irradiated by electromagnetic energy on a person from when it is supported in free space on a low dielectric material is less than 0,5 dB.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The radiation sensor 44 is coupled to the electronic circuitry of the monitor by using a flexible transmission line 68 consisting of at least two leads of carbon impregnated TFE material. The two leads of this transmission line 68 carry the DC output from the sensor to the electronic circuitry. These leads have a resistance of approximately 3937 ohms per centimetre. The two DC leads are connected to one of the four antenna elements 52 and in particular to respective conductive elements 56 at the most outward end of the antenna element, as shown in Fig. 4 of the drawings.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Fig. 7 illustrates one form of an electronic circuit for use with the radiation monitor. Integrated circuit U1<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> acts as a quasi-regulated voltage source, and provides regulated -3 volts on circuit terminal E2 (-V) and unregulated, approximately 9 volts on circuit terminal E1 (+V). Battery B1, which is preferably a 12 volt miniature battery, is coupled across terminals E1 and E2. Diode CR1 acts as a zener diode in a starved condition and provides approximately 3 volts as a reference voltage for integrated circuit U1. Potentiometer R28 provides an adjustment of the regulated -3 volts.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Integrated circuit U4 acts as a comparator. It triggers on a positive going pulse from integrated circuit U3, as will be explained, and latches up through hysteresis (i.e., feedback resistor R7) to cause LED CR3 (which is the visual alarm LED 8) to remain illuminated. The output of circuit U4 is coupled to the base of driver transistor Q1, whose collector is coupled to LED CR3. LED CR3 is powered by an auxiliary 3 volt battery.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Separate 12 volt and 3 volt batteries are used in the monitor to provide a fail-safe measure. Since the LED draws the most current, that is, approximately 500 milliamps, if the LED fails due to a low battery, the rest of the circuit which is powered by the 12 volt battery continues to operate to provide a warning to the user that high RF energy is present. Since the exposure light (i.e., the LED) is powered from a separate battery, maximum life is provided for the battery which powers the audible alarm. The battery for the audible alarm is envisioned to last approximately 30 days in a "sleep" mode and 6 hours in a continuous alarm state. The exposure light will last approximately 100 hours in a continuous lighted state.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Integrated circuit U2 is an operational amplifier configured as a conditioning amplifier with a gain of approximately 1.000. Potentiometer R9 is provided as a<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> gain adjustment. The amplifier amplifies the signal from the radiation sensor which is coupled to circuit terminals E7 and E8, and amplifies that signal before providing it to integrated circuit U3.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Resistor R10, which is coupled to one leg of potentiometer R9, is a sensitor (i.e., a thermally sensitive resistor, or thermistor) and is provided to compensate for temperature variations so that conditioning amplifier U2 will provide more or less gain, as needed, as the temperature varies.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Integrated circuit U3 is a conventional circuit used in smoke detectors. Smoke detector circuit U3 provides a regulated voltage on its pin 1 which, in the case of the monitor circuit, is a 3 volt reference voltage to ground. Resistor R19 and R20 comprise a resistor network which provides a 1 volt alarm threshold on pin 2 of circuit U3. A standard piezo electric transducer 6 is coupled through terminals E4, E5 and E6 to pin numbers 8, 9 and 10 of circuit U3. A suitable transducer which may be used is Part No. PKM 11-6A0 manufactured by Murata-Erie Co.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The resistor circuit shown in dashed line A, in conjunction with potentiometer R26, provides an adjustment to correct the offset bias of conditioning amplifier U2.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The circuit of the radiation monitor of the present invention operates in the following manner. The radiation sensor 44 generates 1 millivolt per 1 milliwatt per square centimetre of RF energy which irradiates it. This signal is carried by the transmission line 68 described previously to the inputs of conditioning amplifier U2. U2 amplifies the 1 millivolt signal from the radiation sensor (that is, when the sensor is irradiated with 1 milliwatt per<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> square centimetre of energy) by 1.000 to provide an output signal which is approximately 1 volt. The 1 volt signal is provided to pin 3 of the smoke detector circuit U3. If the amplified signal from conditioning amplifier U2 is greater than the 1 volt threshold on pin 2 of circuit U3, the output of circuit U3 of pin 12 will provide a positive going pulse through diode CR2 to the non-inverting input (pin 3) of comparator U4.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In response to this pulse, the output of comparator U4, at pin 6, will go to a positive voltage and bias transistor Q1 on. Transistor Q1 will conduct current through LED CR3 to illuminate the LED of the radiation monitor. Hysteresis will keep comparator U4 latched until the circuit is reset.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Also, smoke detector circuit U3 sounds the piezo electric alarm 6 (Fig. 3) when the threshold is exceeded. Circuit U3 further monitors the battery voltage. When the battery voltage drops to approximately 7,5 volts, circuit U3 will cause the alarm to emit a chirp every 40 seconds. If the battery drops further in voltage, the chirps emitted by the alarm will become more frequent until a battery voltage is reached which causes the alarm to emit a continuous warble tone.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The monitor of the present invention further provides a self-test upon turn on. Capacitor C2, which is connected between the input (pin 3) of the conditioning amplifier U2 and the regulated 3 volt output of circuit U3 (at pin 1), is initially uncharged, thus providing a test voltage to be applied to the inputs (pins 3 and 2) of conditioning amplifier U2 through the resistor divider network comprised of resistors R16 and R17 and the input resistor R15. This test voltage is approximately 1 millivolt, which is comparable to the voltage which would be provided by the radiation sensor when the sensor is illuminated with RF energy of 1 milliwatt per<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> square centimetre. The test voltage is amplified by circuit U2, and smoke detector circuit U3 sounds the alarm and causes comparator U4 to go to a positive state on its output, thereby turning on transistor Q1 and illuminating LED CR3. Comparator U4 is not latched under these test conditions. This is because capacitor C8, which is coupled between the regulated -3 volts and the positive supply voltage input (pin 7) of comparator U4 and one side of resistor R8 whose other side is connected to the unregulated 9 volt supply, is initially uncharged. Capacitor C8 prevents the positive supply voltage from being supplied to pin 7 of comparator U4. Circuit U4 will note latch up through hysteresis feedback resistor R7 under these conditions until capacitor C8 has become charged. At that time however, capacitor C2 has become fully charged and effectively removes the test voltage from the inputs of conditioning amplifier U2. The output of amplifier U2 thereby falls below the 1 volt threshold, and the output signal from circuit U3 returns to a low level. This, in turn, causes the output signal of comparator U4 to return to a low logic level, thereby cutting off transistor Q1 and turning off warning LED CR3.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">To ensure that the various capacitors and other components in the electronic circuitry of the monitor are fully discharged when the monitor is shut off, which thereby prevents false alarms as well as prevents comparator U4 from latching, a single pole, double throw switch is used as the on/off switch 12. The positive side of battery B1 is coupled to one pole (S1-1) (fig. 3) of the switch. The wiper terminal (S1-2) (Fig. 3) of the switch is coupled to the E1 terminal of the electronic circuit board. The E2 terminal is connected directly to the negative terminal of the battery and to the other pole (S1-3) (Fig. 3) of the switch. Accordingly, when the switch 12 is in the on position, wiper S1-2 contacts pole S1-1 to provide voltage from<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> battery B1 across terminals E1 and E2. When the switch is in the off position, wiper S1-2 contacts the opposite pole S1-3 and provides a short circuit across terminals E1 and E2. Because transistor Q1 remains cut off, when LED CR3 is not illuminated, negligible current is drawn from battery B2 when the monitor is off.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">A parts list for the circuit shown in Fig. 7 is provided below.

The material 76 is preferably progressively more conductive through its thickness from the back wall 18 of the housing to the conductive shield plate 48, as with the lossy material backing 46 described previously.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The radiation monitor of the present invention accurately detects RF radiation without being affected by body scattering caused by the wearer's body. Its compact size allows it to be worn on a belt using the clip 16 (Fig. 2) provided or in the wearer's pocket. Its broadband frequency performance and independence of polarization make the monitor perfectly adaptable for<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> use in a variety of RF environments. The audible alarm 6 provides a warning of RF exposure, and the LED 8 provides a visual indication as well. The LED latches so as to provide a record that the wearer was exposed to RF energy, in the event the wearer did not hear the audible alarm before he left the danger zone.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The personal electromagnetic radiation monitor of the present invention is further quite suitable for use in high ambient noise environments. The ear plug assembly 20 includes ear plugs which may be used in conjunction with ear phones, and is non-electrically conductive to prevent injury to the wearer and misreadings or damage to the electronic circuitry of the monitor. The Velcro (TM) hook and loop fastener patches used on the ear plug assembly and the housing of the monitor allows the user to quickly and easily connect the ear plug assembly to the transducer on the housing with no electrical connection required.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">An alternative embodiment of the electromagnetic radiation monitor of the present invention, specifically an area (fixed position) electromagnetic radiation monitor 100, is shown in Figure 8.

The backing of graduated lossy material is interposed between the radiation sensor and the conductive shield. The backing is progressively more conductive through its thickness from the first layer 118 to the third layer 120.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">The area (fixed position) electromagnetic radiation monitor 100 is designed to monitor a region near a source of high power radio frequency (RF) or microwave<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> energy.

Contiguous with the second side 104 is a tapered surface 108 which extends up at an angle to meet top level portion 111. In a like manner, a tapered surface 109 and a tapered surface 110 are respectively contiguous with third and fourth sides 105 and 106, extending therefrom at an angle to meet top level portion 111. The optimal taper angle of surface 108, 109 and 110 is 45° so as to provide minimal field distortion.<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --></p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Top level portion 111 has a cylindrical extrusion or boss 112 thereon which encloses the electromagnetic radiation sensor 121.

EP	0610186	B1	2000-03-29	en	DESCR	1	<p id="p0001" num="0001">This invention relates to a process for regenerating spent fluidized catalytic cracking catalyst.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Catalytic cracking is the backbone of many refineries. It converts heavy feeds to lighter products by cracking large molecules into smaller molecules. Catalytic cracking operates at low pressures, without hydrogen addition, in contrast to hydrocracking, which operates at high hydrogen partial pressures. Catalytic cracking is inherently safe as it operates with very little oil actually in inventory during the cracking process.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">There are two main variants of the catalytic cracking process: the moving bed process and the far more popular and efficient fluidized bed process.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In the fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) process, catalyst circulates between a cracking reactor and a catalyst regenerator. In the reactor, hydrocarbon feed contacts a source of hot, regenerated catalyst, which vaporizes and cracks the feed at a temperature of 425-600°C, usually 460-560°C. The cracking reaction deposits carbonaceous hydrocarbons or coke on the catalyst, thereby deactivating the catalyst. The cracked products are separated from the coked catalyst, which is then stripped of volatiles, usually with steam, in a catalyst stripper. The stripped catalyst is then passed to the catalyst regenerator, where coke is burned from the catalyst with oxygen containing gas, usually air. Decoking restores catalyst activity and simultaneously heats the catalyst to, for example, 500-900°C, usually 600-750°C. This heated catalyst is recycled to the cracking reactor to crack more fresh feed. Flue gas formed by burning coke in the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> regenerator may be treated for removal of particulates and for conversion of carbon monoxide, after which the flue gas is normally discharged into the atmosphere.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Catalytic cracking has undergone progressive development since the 1940s, with the trend in fluid catalytic cracking being towards all riser cracking and use of zeolite catalysts.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Riser cracking gives higher yields of valuable products than dense bed cracking. Most FCC units now use all riser cracking, with hydrocarbon residence times in the riser of less than 10 seconds, and even less than 5 seconds.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Zeolite-containing catalysts having high activity and selectivity are now used in most FCC units. These catalysts work best when coke on the catalyst after regeneration is less than 0.2 wt %, and preferably less than 0.05 wt %.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">To regenerate FCC catalysts to these low residual carbon levels, and to burn CO completely to CO2 within the regenerator (to conserve heat and minimize air pollution) many FCC operators add a CO combustion promoter metal to the catalyst or to the regenerator.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">U.S. Patent Nos 4,072,600 and 4,093,535 teach use of combustion-promoting metals such as Pt, Pd, Ir, Rh, Os, Ru and Re in cracking catalysts in concentrations of 0.01 to 50 ppm, based on total catalyst inventory.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">As the process and catalyst have improved, refiners have attempted to use the process to upgrade a wider range of feedstocks, in particular, feedstocks that are heavier, and also contain more metals and sulfur than have previously been permitted in the feed to a fluid catalytic cracking unit. These heavier, dirtier feeds have placed a growing demand on the regenerator. Processing resids has exacerbated existing problem areas in the regenerator, notably steam, temperature and NOx.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> These problems will each be reviewed in more detail below.</p><heading id="h0001"><u>Steam</u></heading><p id="p0011" num="0011">Steam is always present in FCC regenerators although it is known to cause catalyst deactivation. Steam is not intentionally added, but is invariably present, usually as absorbed or entrained steam from steam stripping of the catalyst or as water of combustion formed in the regenerator. Steam deactivation becomes more of a problem as regenerators get hotter, since higher temperatures accelerate the deactivating effects of steam.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>Temperature</u></heading><p id="p0012" num="0012">Regenerators are being required to operate at higher and higher temperatures. This is because most FCC units are heat balanced, that is, the endothermic heat of the cracking reaction is supplied by burning the coke deposited on the catalyst. With heavier feeds, more coke is deposited on the catalyst than is needed for the cracking reaction. The regenerator gets hotter, and the extra heat is rejected as high temperature flue gas. Many refiners severely limit the amount of resid or similar high CCR feeds to that amount which can be tolerated by the unit. High temperatures are a problem for the metallurgy of many units, but more importantly, are a problem for the catalyst. In the regenerator, the burning of coke and unstripped hydrocarbons leads to much higher surface temperatures on the catalyst than the measured dense bed or dilute phase temperature. This is discussed by Occelli et al in Dual-Function Cracking Catalyst Mixtures, Ch. 12, Fluid Catalytic Cracking, ACS Symposium Series 375, American Chemical Society, Washington, D.C., 1988.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Some regenerator temperature control is possible by adjusting the CO/CO<sub>2</sub> ratio produced in the regenerator. Burning coke partially to CO produces less heat than complete combustion to CO<sub>2</sub>. Control of CO/CO<sub>2</sub> ratios is fairly straightforward in single, bubbling bed regenerators, by limiting the amount of air that is added. It is far more difficult to control CO/CO<sub>2</sub> ratios when multi-stage regeneration is involved.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">U.S. Patent No. 4,353,812 to Lomas et al discloses cooling catalyst from a regenerator by passing it through the shell side of a heat-exchanger with a cooling medium being passed through the tube side. This approach will remove heat from the regenerator, but will not prevent poorly, or even well, stripped catalyst from experiencing very high surface or localized temperatures in the regenerator.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The prior art also uses dense or dilute phase regenerated fluid catalyst heat removal zones or heat-exchangers that are remote from, and external to, the regenerator vessel to cool hot regenerated catalyst for return to the regenerator. Examples of such processes are found in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,970,117 to Harper; 2,873,175 to Owens; 2,862,798 to McKinney; 2,596,748 to Watson et al; 2,515,156 to Jahnig et al; 2,492,948 to Berger; and 2,506,123 to Watson.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>NOx</u></heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">Burning of nitrogenous compounds in FCC regenerators has long led to creation of minor amounts of NOx, which in the past was emitted with the regenerator flue gas. Usually these emissions were not much of a problem because of relatively low temperature, a relatively reducing atmosphere from partial combustion of CO and the absence of catalytic metals like Pt in the regenerator which increase NOx production.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Unfortunately, the trend to heavier feeds usually means that the amount of nitrogen compounds on the coke will increase and that NOx emissions will increase. Higher regenerator temperatures also tend to increase NOx emissions. It would be beneficial, in many refineries, to have a way to burn at least a large portion of the nitrogenous coke in a relatively reducing atmosphere, so that much of the NOx formed could be converted into N<sub>2</sub> within the regenerator. Unfortunately, existing multi-stage regenerator designs can not be run with two stages of regeneration, both operating with partial CO combustion, i.e., with a reducing atmosphere.</p><heading id="h0004"><u>High Efficiency Regenerator</u></heading><p id="p0018" num="0018">Most new FCC units use a high efficiency regenerator, which uses a fast fluidized bed coke combustor to burn most of the coke from the catalyst, and a dilute phase transport riser above the coke combustor to afterburn CO to CO<sub>2</sub> and achieve a limited amount of additional coke combustion. Hot regenerated catalyst and flue gas from the coke combustor are discharged from the transport riser, separated, and the regenerated catalyst collected as a second, bubbling dense bed for return to the FCC reactor and recycle to the coke combustor to heat up incoming spent catalyst.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Such regenerators are now widely used. They typically are operated to achieve complete CO combustion within the dilute phase transport riser. They achieve one stage of regeneration, i.e., essentially all of the coke is burned in the coke combustor, with minor amounts being burned in the transport riser. The residence time of the catalyst in the coke combustor is on the order of a few minutes, while the residence time in the transport riser is on the order of a few seconds, so there is generally not enough residence time of catalyst in the<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> transport riser to achieve any significant amount of coke combustion.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Catalyst regeneration in such high efficiency regenerators is essentially a single stage process in that the catalyst and regeneration gas and produced flue gas remain together from the coke combustor through the dilute phase transport riser. Almost no further regeneration of catalyst occurs downstream of the coke combustor, because very little air is added to the second, bubbling dense bed used to collect regenerated catalyst for recycle to the reactor or the coke combustor. Usually enough air is added to fluff the catalyst, and allow efficient transport of catalyst around the bubbling dense bed. Less than 5 %, and usually less than 1 %, of the coke combustion takes place in the second dense bed.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Such units are popular in part because of their efficiency, i.e., the fast fluidized bed, with recycle of hot regenerated catalyst, is so efficient at burning coke that the regenerator can operate with only half the catalyst inventory required in an FCC unit with a bubbling dense bed regenerator.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">With the trend to heavier feedstocks, the catalyst regenerator is frequently pushed to the limit of its coke burning capacity. Addition of cooling coils, as discussed above in the <u>Temperature</u> discussion, provides some help, but causes additional problems. High efficiency regenerators run best when operated in complete CO combustion mode, so attempts to shift some of the heat of combustion to a downstream CO boiler are difficult to implement.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The use of a high efficiency regenerator to achieve staged catalyst regeneration will allow some reduction in NOx emissions, while some recovery of SOx will still be possible. Other benefits also flow from multistage operation, such as reduced steaming of catalyst, because<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> of lower average temperatures, and less damage from metals, because at least some of the regeneration is conducted in a somewhat reducing atmosphere which retards formation of highly oxidized forms of vanadium. One such regenerator is disclosed in US 4,849,091, which keeps the air supply to the coke combustor constant, and changes the air supply to the second dense bed based on a dilute phase temperature, which indicates afterburning. There is only partial combustion of coke and CO in the coke combustor, with relatively complete coke and CO combustion in the second dense bed. The reducing flue gas from the coke combustor (with a CO2/CO ratio of 0.7 to 2.0) is combined with the flue gas from the second dense bed, which operates with substantially complete CO combustion to produce a flue gas with at least 0.5% O<sub>2</sub>. The two flue gas streams are combined to form flue gas containing a CO<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio from 1 to 5.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The present invention seeks to provide an improved process for effecting high efficiency multi-stage regeneration of spent FCC catalyst in which changes in coke make are dealt with either by changing the coke burning rates in both the coke combustor and the second dense bed, or at least in the coke combustor. This is a preferred arrangement because the coke combustor is the most vigorously fluidized, and most robust place in the regenerator for coke combustion. The fast fluidized bed region is not plagued by the presence of many large bubbles, unlike the second dense bed of many high efficiency regenerators. The fast fluidized bed region is essentially entirely active, while much, and perhaps even a majority, of a bubbling dense phase fluidized bed is inactive. For these reasons, it is preferable to keep the operation of the second stage of regeneration relatively constant, while adjusting coke burning in the fast fluidized bed coke combustor.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Accordingly, the present invention resides in a process for regenerating spent fluidized catalytic cracking catalyst comprising the steps of:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>a) partially regenerating said spent cracking catalyst in a primary regeneration zone, comprising a fast fluidized bed coke combustor and a superimposed dilute phase transport riser, by charging said spent catalyst to said fast fluidized bed coke combustor having an inlet for spent catalyst, an inlet for recycled regenerated catalyst and an inlet for primary regeneration gas, to produce partially regenerated catalyst and flue gas comprising at least 1.0 mole % CO, which are passed up into the dilute phase transport riser and discharged therefrom to form a flue gas rich stream comprising at least 1 mole % CO and a catalyst rich stream comprising partially regenerated catalyst; and</li><li>b) completing the regeneration of said partially regenerated catalyst in a secondary regeneration zone comprising a second fluidized bed adapted to receive said partially regenerated catalyst and having means for adding additional regeneration gas to said second fluidized bed in an amount sufficient to complete the regeneration of said catalyst and produce regenerated catalyst and secondary flue gas; wherein:<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>i) the CO-containing flue gas stream from the said dilute phase transport riser is combined with said secondary flue gas to produce a combined flue gas stream;</li><li>ii) the conditions in said secondary regeneration zone are controlled such that said secondary flue gas contains less than 1 mole % CO and contains sufficient oxygen to react with the CO-containing flue gas stream from the said dilute transport riser;<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></li><li>iii) at least one flue gas composition or a differential temperature in said combined flue gas stream is monitored; and</li><li>iv) the amount of primary regeneration gas supplied to said fast fluidized bed coke combustor is controlled so as to maintain constant said monitored flue gas composition or differential temperature.</li></ul></li></ul></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The invention will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>Figure 1 is a simplified schematic view of one example of the invention using flue gas composition, or a delta T indicating afterburning, to control air addition to the coke combustor of a multistage FCC high efficiency regenerator.</li><li>Figure 2 is a simplified view of the same regenerator using a flue gas analyzer, or temperature, to control total air flow, and a fluid bed dT controller to apportion air between the fluidized beds.</li><li>Figure 3 shows the same regenerator wherein a flue gas analyzer controller, and/or a delta T controller, changes feed preheat and/or feed rate.</li></ul></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Referring to the drawings, the FCC reactor section in each example is the same and includes a riser reactor 4, into the lower end of which a heavy feed is charged via line 1. Hot regenerated catalyst is added to the reactor 4 via standpipe 102 and control valve 104 to mix with the feed. Preferably, some atomizing steam is added via line 141 to the base of the riser, usually with the feed. With heavier feeds, e. g. , a resid, 2-10 wt.% steam may be used. A hydrocarbon-catalyst mixture rises as a generally dilute phase through riser 4. Cracked products and coked catalyst are discharged via riser effluent conduit 6 into first stage cyclone 8 in vessel 2. The riser top temperature, the temperature in conduit 6, ranges between 480 and 615°C (900 and<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> 1150°F), and preferably between 538 and 595°C (1000 and 1050° F). The riser top temperature is usually controlled by adjusting the catalyst to oil ratio in riser 4 or by varying feed preheat.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Cyclone 8 separates most of the catalyst from the cracked products and discharges the separated catalyst via dipleg 12 to a stripping zone 30 located in a lower portion of vessel 2.

A preferred closed cyclone system is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,502,947 to Haddad et al.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Stripper 30 is a "hot stripper" in that spent catalyst is mixed and heated in bed 31 by hot catalyst from the regenerator. Catalyst from regenerator 80 enters vessel 2 via transfer line 106, and slide valve 108 which controls catalyst flow. Adding hot,<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> regenerated catalyst permits first stage stripping at from 55°C (100°F) above the riser top temperature up to a temperature of 816°C (1500°F).

Coke is removed because carbon in the unstripped hydrocarbons is burned as coke in the regenerator. The sulfur is removed as hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans. The hydrogen is removed as molecular hydrogen, hydrocarbons, and hydrogen sulfide. The removed materials also increase the recovery of valuable liquid products, because the stripper vapors can be sent to product recovery with the bulk of the cracked products from the riser reactor. High temperature stripping can reduce coke load to the regenerator by 30 to 50% or more and remove 50-80% of the hydrogen and 35 to 55% of the sulfur, as well as a portion of nitrogen as ammonia and cyanides.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Although a hot stripping zone is shown in Figure 1, the present invention may also be used with conventional strippers, or with long residence time steam strippers, or with strippers having internal or external heat exchange means.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Although not shown in Figure 1, an internal or external catalyst stripper/cooler, with inlets for hot catalyst and fluidization gas, arid outlets for cooled catalyst and stripper vapor, may also be used where desired to cool the stripped catalyst before it enters the regenerator 80.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The regenerator 80 comprises two regeneration stages, that is a first coke combustor 62/transport riser 83 and a second fluidized bed 82, which is preferably a dense bed or bubbling fluidized bed. Partial CO combustion is maintained in the first stage while the second stage of catalyst regeneration operates in complete CO combustion mode.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The stripped catalyst passes through a conduit 42 into regenerator riser 60, where air from line 66 and stripped catalyst combine and pass up through an air catalyst disperser 74 into coke combustor 62. A fast fluidized bed 76 of catalyst is thereby produced in the coke combustor so that combustible materials, such as coke on the catalyst, are burned by contact with air or oxygen containing gas.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The amount of air or oxygen containing gas added via line 66, to the base of the riser mixer 60, is preferably constant and preferably restricted to 10-95% of the total air addition to the first stage of regeneration. Additional air, preferably 5-50 % of total air, is added to the coke combustor via line 160 and air ring 167. The partitioning of the first stage air, between the riser mixer 60 and the air ring 167 in the coke combustor, can be fixed or controlled by a differential temperature, e.g., the temperature rise in riser mixer 60. The total amount of air addition to the first stage, i.e., the regeneration in the coke combustor and riser mixer is controlled to maintain only partial coke removal and only partial CO combustion, so that the CO content of the first stage flue gas is in excess of 1 mole%. The control method will be discussed in more detail later.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The temperature of fast fluidized bed 76 in the coke combustor 62 may be, and preferably is, increased by recycling some hot regenerated catalyst from the second fluidized bed 82 via line 101 and control valve<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> 103. If temperatures in the coke combustor are too high, some heat can be removed via catalyst cooler 48, shown as tubes immersed in the fast fluidized bed in the coke combustor. Very efficient heat transfer can be achieved in the fast fluidized bed 76, so it may be beneficial to both heat the coke combustor (by recycling hot catalyst to it) and to cool the coke combustor (by using catalyst cooler 48) at the same time.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In coke combustor 62, the combustion air, regardless of whether added via line 66 or 160, fluidizes the catalyst in bed 76, and subsequently transports the catalyst continuously as a dilute phase through the regenerator riser 83. The dilute phase passes upwardly through the riser 83, through riser outlet 306 into primary regenerator cyclone 308. Catalyst is discharged down through dipleg 84 to form a second relatively dense bed of catalyst 82 located within the regenerator 80.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">While most of the catalyst passes down through the dipleg 84, the flue gas and some catalyst pass via outlet 310 into the dilute phase region above the second fluidized bed. An additional stage of separation of catalyst from the combined flue gas flue gas streams is achieved in secondary cyclone 486, with catalyst recovered via dipleg 490 and flue gas discharged via gas exhaust line 488 to plenum 520. Flue gas, with a greatly reduced solids content is discharged from the regenerator 80 via line 100.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The hot, regenerated catalyst discharged from the various cyclones forms the second fluidized bed 82, which is hotter than any other fluid bed in the regenerator, and hotter than the stripping zone 30. Bed 82 is at least 55°C (100°F), and preferably at least 83°C (150°F), hotter than stripping zone 31. The regenerator temperature is preferably no more than 870°C (1600°F) to prevent deactivating the catalyst.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> Preferably, some hot regenerated catalyst is withdrawn from dense bed 82 and passed via line 106 and control valve 108 into dense bed of catalyst 31 in stripper 30.

There will always be large amounts of coke on catalyst exiting the riser. Combustion air to the second stage is maintained at a constant rate, or changed only infrequently to suit changing conditions. The second stage flue gas, e.g., CO or O2 content controls the amount of air added to the first stage 62, 83.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In the Fig 1 embodiment, air addition to the coke combustor 62 is controlled by a delta T controller 410 which is connected to thermocouples 400 and 405 in the outlet to the transport riser and the dilute phase region above the second fluidized bed respectively. The output from the controller 410 is sent via control line 415 to alter air flow through valve 420 which supplies air to the coke combustor via line 160. The air flow via line 78 to the upper dense bed is fixed, i.e., a conventional control means admits a fixed volume of air.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">If the CO content of the second stage flue gas increases above 1 mole % CO, or a lower preset maximum CO concentration, in response to a major change in feed characteristics or operating conditions, this means that the second fluidized bed is not able to completely afterburn all the CO produced in the second fluidized bed. The delta T observed by the thermocouples 400, 405 will drop and the dT controller 410 send a signal to the valve 420 to increase the air supply to the coke combustor 62. If second stage flue gas CO content decreases, e.g., to 0.05 mole %, or too much oxygen<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> breaks through the second stage, this means the second stage is not being worked hard enough, so the amount of air added to the first stage will be decreased to shift more of the coke burning load to the second stage of regeneration.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">In an alternative embodiment, shown by the broken lines in Figure 1, a flue gas analyzer 625 is used in place of the dT controller 410 to measure the composition of the flue gas from the second regeneration stage. The flue gas analyzer 625 sends a signal via signal transmission means 615 to valve 420 to control air flow to the coke combustor.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The embodiment shown in Figure 1 provides a relatively simple and reliable control scheme (use of a flue gas composition or delta T indicative of a composition of flue gas above the second fluidized bed) which can accommodate normal minor changes in operation, and even be adjusted to deal with major changes in operation.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">It will be beneficial in many refineries if the relatively large amount of coke burning in both the primary and secondary stage of the regenerator can be directly controlled.

The difference in the Fig. 2 embodiment is simultaneous adjustment of both primary and secondary air. This can be seen more easily in conjunction with a review of Figure 2. Elements which correspond to Fig. 1 elements have the same reference numerals, and are not discussed. Fig 2 also includes, besides reference numerals, symbols indicating temperature differences, e.g., dT<sub>12</sub> means<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> that a signal is developed indicative of the temperature difference between temperature 1 and temperature 2.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The amount of air added to the riser mixer is fixed, for simplicity, but this is merely to simplify the following analysis. The riser mixer air is merely part of the primary air, and could vary with any variations in flow of air to the coke combustor. It is also possible to operate the regenerator with no riser mixer at all, in which case spent catalyst, recycled regenerated catalyst, and primary air are all added directly to the coke combustor. The riser mixer is, however, preferred.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The control scheme will first be stated in general terms, then reviewed in conjunction with Fig. 2. The overall amount of combustion air, i.e., the total air to the regenerator, is controlled based on either the composition or temperature of the combined flue gas or a differential temperature indicating afterburning downstream of the second fluidized bed. Controlling or apportioning the air added to each combustion zone allows unit operation to be optimized even when the operator does not know the individual optima for the first and second stages. If the second fluidized bed, typically a bubbling dense bed with fairly poor contacting efficiency, is being called on to do too much afterburning, an increased dT in the flue gas, will occur. The unit can be controlled by increasing the air rate to the coke combustor and decreasing air flow to the second dense bed, and letting the controller keep the relative amount of coke burned in the first and second stages constant regardless of future fluctuations in coke make.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">In the Fig. 2 embodiment, the control scheme apportions air between the first and second stages of the regenerator. This is a more complicated control method than was used in Figure 1, but will usually allow<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> better operation. An operator may specify e.g., that 40 % of the coke will be burned in the first stage and 60 % burned in the second stage, regardless of fluctuations in coke make. Several control loops are needed, basically at least one loop to control total air addition to the regenerator based on a measurement of the flue gas from the unit, and one loop to shift air between the first and second stage to keep the relative amounts of coke combustion in each stage constant.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The total air flow in line 358 is controlled by means of a flue gas analyzer 361 or preferably by temperature controller 350 and thermocouple 336 which are in the dilute phase region above the second fluidized bed. Either temperature or flue gas composition can be used to generate a control signal which is transmitted via transmission means 352 or 362 (an air line, or a digital or analogue electrical signal or equivalent signal transmission means) to valve 360 which regulates the total air flow to the regenerator via line 358.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The apportionment of air between the primary and secondary stages of regeneration is controlled by the differences in temperature of the two relatively dense phase beds in the regenerator. The temperature (T1) in the coke combustor fast fluidized bed is determined by thermocouple 330. The bubbling dense bed temperature (T2) is determined by thermocouple 332. Both temperature signals are sent to differential temperature controller 338, which generates a signal based on dT12, or the difference in temperature between the two beds. Signals are sent via means 356 to valve 372, which regulates primary air to the coke combustor and via means 354 to valve 72, which regulates secondary air to bubbling dense bed.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">If the delta T (dT12) becomes too large, it means that not enough coke burning is taking place in the coke<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> combustor, and too much coke burning is occurring in the second dense bed. The dT controller 338 will compensate by sending more combustion air to the coke combustor, and less to the bubbling dense bed.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">There are several other temperature control points which can be used besides the ones shown. Thus the operation of the coke combustor can be measured by the fast fluidized bed temperature (as shown), by the temperature in the dilute phase of the coke combustor or in the dilute phase transport riser, or the temperature measured in the primary cyclone or on a flue gas stream or catalyst stream discharged from the primary cyclone. A flue gas or catalyst composition measurement can also be used to generate a signal indicative of the amount of coke combustion occurring in the fast fluidized bed, but this will generally not be as sensitive as simply measuring the bed temperature in the coke combustor.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">The designations "primary air" and "secondary air" do not require that a majority of the coke combustion take place in the coke combustor. In most instances, the fast fluidized bed region will be the most efficient place to burn coke, but there are considerations, such as reduced steaming of catalyst if regenerated in the bubbling dense bed, and reduced thermal deactivation of catalyst by delaying as long as possible as much of the carbon burning as possible, which may make it beneficial to burn most of the coke with the "secondary air". This will usually require substantial unit modifications, to increase the size of the second fluidized bed, and to increase the bed superficial vapor velocity so that better fluidization is achieved.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">It is possible to magnify or to depress the difference in temperature between the coke combustor and the bubbling dense bed by changing the amount of hot regenerated catalyst which is recycled. Operation with large amounts of recycle, i.e., recycling more than 1 or<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> 2 weights of catalyst from the bubbling dense bed per weight of spent catalyst, will depress temperature differences between the two regions. Differential temperature control can still be used, but the gain and/or setpoint on the controller may have to be adjusted because recycle of large amounts of catalyst from the second dense bed will increase the temperature in the fast fluidized bed coke combustor.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">The control method of Fig. 2. will be preferred for most refineries. Another method of control is shown in Fig. 3, which can be used as an alternative to the Fig. 2 method. The Fig. 3 control method retains the ability to apportion combustion air between the primary and secondary stages of regeneration, but adjusts feed preheat, and/or feed rate, rather than total combustion air, to maintain partial CO combustion in the coke combustor and complete CO combustion in the second fluidized bed. The Fig. 3 control method is especially useful where a refiner's air blower capacity is limiting the throughput of the FCC unit. Leaving the air blower at maximum, and adjusting feed preheat and/or feed rate, will maximize the coke burning capacity of the unit by always running the air blower at maximum throughput.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">In the Fig. 3 embodiment, the total amount of air added via line 358 is controlled solely by the capacity of the compressor or air blower. The apportionment of air between primary and secondary stages of combustion is controlled as in the Fig. 2 embodiment, except that a flue gas dT, rather than a flue gas temperature, is used to adjust coke make. Feed preheat and/or feed rate are adjusted as necessary to keep the coke make in balance with the coke burned in the first stage (partial CO combustion) and in the second stage (complete CO combustion). Each variable changes the coke make of the unit, and each will be reviewed in more detail below.<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --></p><p id="p0062" num="0062">Feed preheat can control afterburning because of the way FCC reactors are run. The FCC reactor usually operates with a controlled riser top temperature. The hydrocarbon feed in line 1 is mixed with sufficient hot, regenerated catalyst from line 102 to maintain a given riser top temperature. This is the way most FCC units operate. The temperature can be measured at other places in the reactor, as in the middle of the riser, at the riser outlet, cracked product outlet, or a spent catalyst temperature before or after stripping, but usually the riser top temperature is used to control the amount of catalyst added to the base of the riser to crack fresh feed. If the feed is preheated to a very high temperature, and much or all of the feed is added as a vapor, less catalyst will be needed as compared to operation with a relatively cold liquid feed which is vaporized by hot catalyst. High feed preheat reduces the amount of catalyst circulation needed to maintain a given riser top temperature, and this reduced catalyst circulation rate reduces coke make. A constant air supply and a reduced coke make, regardless of the reason for the reduction in coke make, will increase the O2 content of the flue gas.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">If the O2 content of the flue gas above the bubbling dense bed increases (or if CO content drops) a composition based control signal from analyzer controller 361 may be sent via signal transmission means 384 to feed preheater 380 or to valve 390. Decreasing feed preheat, i.e., a cooler feed, increases coke make. Increasing feed rate increases coke make. Either action, or both together, will increase the coke make, and bring flue gas composition back to the desired point. A differential temperature control 350 may generate an analogous signal, transmitted via means 382 to adjust preheat and/or feed rate.<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --></p><p id="p0064" num="0064">The air is apportioned between the first and second stages as in the Fig. 2 embodiment, i.e., a dT controller maintains a temperature difference, which indirectly sets the amount of coke burned in each stage.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">The Fig. 3 embodiment provides a good way to accommodate unusually bad feeds, with CCR levels exceeding 5 or 10 wt %. Partial CO combustion, with downstream combustion of CO, in a CO boiler, and constant maximum air rate maximize the coke burning capacity of the regenerator using an existing air blower of limited capacity.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">A number of mechanical modifications may be made to the high efficiency regenerator without departing from the scope of the present invention. It is possible to use the control scheme of the present invention even when additional catalyst/flue gas separation means are present. As an example, the riser mixer 60 may discharge into a cyclone or other separation means contained within the coke combustor. The resulting flue gas may be separately withdrawn from the unit, without entering the dilute phase transport riser. Such a regenerator configuration is shown in EP-A-0259115, published on March 9, 1988.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">Now that the invention has been reviewed in connection with the embodiments shown in the Figures, a more detailed discussion of the different parts of the process and apparatus of the present invention follows. Many elements of the present invention can be conventional, such as the cracking catalyst, or are readily available from vendors, so only a limited discussion of such elements is necessary.</p><heading id="h0005"><u>FCC Feed</u></heading><p id="p0068" num="0068">Any conventional FCC feed can be used. The process of the present invention is especially useful for processing difficult charge stocks, those with high<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> levels of CCR material, exceeding 2, 3, 5 and even 10 wt % CCR. The process tolerates feeds which are relatively high in nitrogen content, and which otherwise might produce unacceptable NOx emissions in conventional FCC units, operating with complete CO combustion.</p><p id="p0069" num="0069">The feeds may range from the typical, such as petroleum distillates or residual stocks, either virgin or partially refined, to the atypical, such as coal oils and shale oils. The feed frequently will contain recycled hydrocarbons, such as light and heavy cycle oils which have already been subjected to cracking.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">Preferred feeds are gas oils, vacuum gas oils, atmospheric resids, and vacuum resids.

The catalyst can be 100% amorphous, but preferably includes some zeolite in a porous refractory matrix such as silica-alumina, clay, or the like. The zeolite is usually 5-40 wt.% of the catalyst, with the rest being matrix. Conventional zeolites include X and Y zeolites, with ultra stable, or relatively high silica Y zeolites being preferred. Dealuminized Y (DEAL Y) and ultrahydrophobic Y (UHP Y) zeolites may be used. The zeolites may be stabilized with Rare Earths, e.g., 0.1 to 10 Wt % RE.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">Relatively high silica zeolite containing catalysts are preferred for use in the present invention. They withstand the high temperatures usually associated with complete combustion of CO to CO2 within the FCC regenerator.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">The catalyst inventory may also contain one or more additives, either present as separate additive particles or mixed in with each particle of the cracking catalyst.<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> Additives can be added to enhance octane (shape selective zeolites, i.e., those having a Constraint Index of 1-12, preferably ZSM-5), adsorb SOX (alumina), and remove Ni and V (Mg and Ca oxides).</p><heading id="h0007"><u>FCC Reactor Conditions</u></heading><p id="p0074" num="0074">Conventional FCC reactor conditions may be used. The reactor may be either a riser cracking unit or dense bed unit or both. Riser cracking is highly preferred. Typical riser cracking reaction conditions include catalyst/oil ratios of 0.5:1 to 15:1 and preferably 3:1 to 8:1, and a catalyst contact time of 0.5-50 seconds, and preferably 1-20 seconds.</p><p id="p0075" num="0075">It is preferred, but not essential, to use an atomizing feed mixing nozzle in the base of the riser reactor.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">It is preferred, but not essential, to have a riser acceleration zone in the base of the riser, as shown in Figures 1 and 2.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">It is preferred, but not essential, to have the riser reactor discharge into a closed cyclone system for rapid and efficient separation of cracked products from spent catalyst.

Hot strippers heat spent catalyst by adding some hot, regenerated catalyst to spent catalyst. The hot stripper reduces the hydrogen content of the spent catalyst sent to the regenerator and reduces the coke content as well. Thus, the hot stripper helps control the temperature and amount of hydrothermal<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> deactivation of catalyst in the regenerator. A good hot stripper design is shown in US 4,820,404 Owen.</p><heading id="h0008"><u>Catalyst Regeneration</u></heading><p id="p0080" num="0080">The process and apparatus of the present invention can use many conventional elements most of which are conventional in FCC regenerators.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">The present invention uses as its starting point a high efficiency regenerator such as is shown in the Figures. The essential elements of such a regenerator include a coke combustor, a dilute phase transport riser and a second fluidized bed, which is usually a bubbling dense bed. The second fluidized bed can also be a turbulent fluidized bed, or even another fast fluidized bed, but unit modifications will then frequently be required. Preferably, a riser mixer is used. These elements are generally known.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">Preferably there is quick separation of catalyst from steam laden flue gas exiting the regenerator transport riser. A significantly increased catalyst inventory in the second fluidized bed of the regenerator, and means for adding a significant amount of combustion air for coke combustion in the second fluidized bed are preferably present or added.</p><p id="p0083" num="0083">Each part of the regenerator will be briefly reviewed below, starting with the riser mixer and ending with the regenerator flue gas cyclones.</p><p id="p0084" num="0084">Spent catalyst and some combustion air are charged to the riser mixer 60. Some regenerated catalyst, recycled through the catalyst stripper, will usually be mixed in with the spent catalyst. Some regenerated catalyst may also be directly recycled to the base of the riser mixer 60, either directly or, preferably, after passing through a catalyst cooler. Riser mixer 60 is a preferred way to get the regeneration started. The riser mixer typically burns most of the fast coke<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> (probably representing entrained or adsorbed hydrocarbons) and a very small amount of the hard coke. The residence time in the riser mixer is usually very short. The amount of hydrogen and carbon removed, and the reaction conditions needed to achieve this removal are reported below. <tables id="tabl0001" num="0001"><table frame="all"><tgroup cols="5" colsep="1" rowsep="0"><colspec colnum="1" colname="col1" colwidth="31.50mm"/><colspec colnum="2" colname="col2" colwidth="31.50mm"/><colspec colnum="3" colname="col3" colwidth="31.50mm"/><colspec colnum="4" colname="col4" colwidth="31.50mm"/><colspec colnum="5" colname="col5" colwidth="31.50mm"/><thead valign="top"><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col5" align="center">RISER MIXER CONDITIONS</entry></row><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col2"/><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="center">Good</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="left">Preferred</entry><entry namest="col5" nameend="col5" align="center">Best</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" morerows="1" align="left">Inlet Temp.</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left">°F</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">900-1200</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="right">925-1100</entry><entry namest="col5" nameend="col5" align="right">950-1050</entry></row><row><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left">°C</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">480- 650</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="right">500- 595</entry><entry namest="col5" nameend="col5" align="right">510- 565</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" morerows="1" align="left">Temp.

This flue gas stream contains a fairly large amount of steam, from adsorbed stripping steam entrained with the spent catalyst and from water of combustion. Many FCC regenerators operate with 35-70 kPa (5-10 psia) steam partial pressure in the flue gas. In the process of the present invention, the dilute phase mixture is preferably quickly separated into a catalyst rich dense phase and a catalyst lean dilute phase.</p><p id="p0091" num="0091">The quick separation of catalyst and flue gas sought in the regenerator transport riser outlet is very<!-- EPO <DP n="29"> --> similar to the quick separation of catalyst and cracked products sought in the riser reactor outlet.</p><p id="p0092" num="0092">The most preferred separation system effects discharge of the regenerator transport riser dilute phase into a closed cyclone system such as that disclosed in US 4,502,947. Such a system rapidly and effectively separates catalyst from steam laden flue gas and isolates and removes the flue gas from the regenerator vessel. This means that catalyst in the regenerator downstream of the transport riser outlet will be in a relatively steam free atmosphere, and the catalyst will not deactivate as quickly as in prior art units.</p><p id="p0093" num="0093">Other methods of effecting a rapid separation of catalyst from steam laden flue gas may also be used, but most of these will not work as well as the use of closed cyclones. Acceptable separation means include a capped riser outlet discharging catalyst down through an annular space defined by the riser top and a covering cap. In older FCC's a reasonably efficient multistage regeneration of catalyst can be achieved by reducing the air added to the coke combustor and increasing the air added to the second fluidized bed. The reduced vapor velocity in the transport riser, and increased vapor velocity immediately above the second fluidized bed, will more or less segregate the flue gas from the transport riser from the flue gas from the second fluidized bed.</p><p id="p0094" num="0094">In a preferred embodiment, the transport riser outlet may be capped with radial arms, not shown, which direct the bulk of the catalyst into large diplegs leading down into the second fluidized bed of catalyst in the regenerator. Such a regenerator riser outlet is disclosed in US Patent 4,810,360.</p><p id="p0095" num="0095">Regardless of the method chosen, at least 90 % of the catalyst discharged from the transport riser<!-- EPO <DP n="30"> --> preferably is quickly discharged into a second fluidized bed, discussed below. At least 90 % of the flue gas exiting the transport riser should be removed from the vessel without further contact with catalyst. This can be achieved to some extent by proper selection of bed geometry in the second fluidized bed, i.e., use of a relatively tall but thin containment vessel 80, and careful control of fluidizing conditions in the second fluidized bed.</p><p id="p0096" num="0096">The second fluidized bed achieves a second stage of regeneration of the catalyst, in a relatively dry atmosphere. The multistage regeneration of catalyst is beneficial from a temperature standpoint alone, i.e., it keeps the average catalyst temperature lower than the last stage temperature. This can be true even when the temperature of regenerated catalyst is exactly the same as in prior art units, because when staged regeneration is used the catalyst does not reach the highest temperature until the last stage. The hot catalyst has a relatively lower residence time at the highest temperature in a multistage regeneration process.</p><p id="p0097" num="0097">The second fluidized bed bears a superficial resemblance to the second dense bed used in prior art, high efficiency regenerators. There are several important differences which bring about profound changes in the function of the second fluidized bed.</p><p id="p0098" num="0098">In prior art second dense beds, the catalyst was merely collected and recycled (to the reactor and frequently to the coke combustor). Catalyst temperatures were typically 680-730°C (1250-1350°F), with some operating slightly hotter, perhaps approaching 760°C (1400°F). The average residence time of catalyst was usually 60 seconds or less. A small amount of air, typically around 1 or 2 % of the total air added to the regenerator, was added to the dense bed to keep it fluidized and enable it to flow into collectors for<!-- EPO <DP n="31"> --> recycle to the reactor. The superficial gas velocity in the bed was typically less than 15 cm/s (0.5 fps), usually 3cm/s (0.1 fps). The bed was relatively dense, bordering on incipient fluidization. This was efficient use of the second dense bed as a catalyst collector, but meant that little or no regeneration of catalyst was achieved in the second dense bed. Because of the low vapor velocity in the bed, very poor use would be made of even the small amounts of oxygen added to the bed. Large fluidized beds such as this are characterized, or plagued, by generally poor fluidization, and relatively large gas bubbles.</p><p id="p0099" num="0099">In the present process, the second fluidized bed plays a much more significant role in regenerating the catalyst. To achieve this, the first step is to provide an increased residence time in the second fluidized bed, typically of at least 1 minute, and preferably much longer. This increased residence time can be achieved by adding more catalyst to the unit, and letting it accumulate in the second fluidized bed. In addition, in the present process much more air is added to the second fluidized bed for several reasons. First, more carbon burning occurs in the second fluidized bed, so the air is needed for combustion. Second, to improve fluidization in the second fluidized bed, much higher superficial vapor velocities are necessary. Also the density of the catalyst in the second fluidized bed is decreased. This reduced density is a characteristic of better fluidization, and also somewhat beneficial in that although the present bed may be twice as high as a bed of the prior art it will not have to contain twice as much catalyst.<!-- EPO <DP n="32"> --> <tables id="tabl0004" num="0004"><table frame="all"><tgroup cols="5" colsep="1" rowsep="0"><colspec colnum="1" colname="col1" colwidth="31.50mm"/><colspec colnum="2" colname="col2" colwidth="31.50mm"/><colspec colnum="3" colname="col3" colwidth="31.50mm"/><colspec colnum="4" colname="col4" colwidth="31.50mm"/><colspec colnum="5" colname="col5" colwidth="31.50mm"/><thead valign="top"><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col5" align="center">SECOND DENSE BED CONDITIONS</entry></row><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col2"/><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="center">Good</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="center">Preferred</entry><entry namest="col5" nameend="col5" align="center">Best</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" morerows="1" align="left">Temperature</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left">°F</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">1200-1700</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="right">1300-1600</entry><entry namest="col5" nameend="col5" align="right">1350-1500</entry></row><row><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left">°C</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">650 -930</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="right">700 -870</entry><entry namest="col5" nameend="col5" align="right">730 -815</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col2" align="left">Catalyst Residence Time, Seconds</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">30 -500</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="right">45 -200</entry><entry namest="col5" nameend="col5" align="right">60 -180</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" morerows="1" align="left">Vapor velocity,</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left">fps</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">0.5 -5</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="right">1 - 4</entry><entry namest="col5" nameend="col5" align="right">1.5 3.5</entry></row><row><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left">m/s</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">0.15-1.5</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="right">0.3- 1.2</entry><entry namest="col5" nameend="col5" align="right">0.5 -1.1</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col2" align="left">% total air added</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">0 - 90</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="right">2 - 60</entry><entry namest="col5" nameend="col5" align="right">5 - 40</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col2" align="left">H2 Removal, %</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">0 - 25</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="right">1 - 10</entry><entry namest="col5" nameend="col5" align="right">1 - 5</entry></row><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col2" align="left">Carbon Removal, %</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">10 - 70</entry><entry namest="col4" nameend="col4" align="right">5 - 60</entry><entry namest="col5" nameend="col5" align="right">10 - 40</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p0100" num="0100">Operating the second fluidized bed with more catalyst inventory, and higher superficial vapor velocity, allows an extra stage of catalyst regeneration, either to achieve cleaner catalyst or to more gently remove the carbon and thereby extend catalyst life.

The steam laden flue gas should be isolated from the catalyst collected in the second fluidized bed. Preferably a closed cyclone system is used to separate and isolate steam laden flue gas from catalyst.</p><p id="p0106" num="0106">Preferably much, and even most, of the coke combustion occurs in the dry atmosphere of the second fluidized bed. Temperatures in the second fluidized bed<!-- EPO <DP n="34"> --> are high, so rapid coke combustion can be achieved even in a bubbling fluidized bed.</p><p id="p0107" num="0107">The process of the present invention permits continuous on stream optimization of the catalyst regeneration process. Achieving a significant amount of coke combustion in the second fluidized bed of a high efficiency regenerator also increases the coke burning capacity of the unit, for very little capital expenditure.</p><p id="p0108" num="0108">The process of the present invention gives refiners a way to achieve the benefits of multi-stage catalyst regeneration in a high efficiency catalyst regenerator. The process accommodates the inevitable changes in coke make that occur in FCC operation by forcing most of the change to be dealt with in the coke combustor, which is the most robust, and controllable, place to burn coke in an FCC regenerator.</p><p id="p0109" num="0109">Both coke combustion and afterburning in the coke combustor can be limited to a great extent by restricting the amount of combustion air added to the coke combustor, provided the unit does not contain excessive amounts of CO combustion promoter.</p><p id="p0110" num="0110">Preferably, the coke burning characteristics of the coke combustor are varied directly, by controllably limiting the amount of hot regenerated catalyst recycled to the coke combustor from the second fluidized bed. In an extreme case, little or no hot regenerated catalyst is recycled to the coke combustor. Because the incoming catalyst is relatively cool, i.e., is merely at the temperature at which it is withdrawn from the catalyst stripper, carbon burning rates are very low even though there is intense fluidization in the coke combustor. At the generally low temperature which prevails in a coke combustor operating without catalyst recycle, there is usually not sufficient residence time to burn more than 10 - 90 % of the coke on the spent catalyst, and usually<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> only 20 - 75 % of the coke will be burned in the primary regeneration stage consisting of the coke combustor and the dilute phase transport riser. The relatively low temperatures also hinder to some extent the afterburning of CO to CO2. Thus there will always be a relatively large amount of CO present, whether produced by coke combustion or to a lesser extent by the reaction of CO2 with carbon.</p><p id="p0111" num="0111">For maximum efficiency, refiners will keep relatively constant operation in the second fluidized bed, and make most of the changes to unit operation occur in the coke combustor. It is also possible to change the operation of the primary and secondary stages of regeneration together, so that the relative amounts of coke burning in each stage remain constant.</p><p id="p0112" num="0112">By operating in accordance with the teachings of the present invention, refiners will be able to obtain the benefits of coke burning in a generally reducing atmosphere (less NOx, reduced formation of highly oxidized forms of vanadium, lower temperatures, greater coke burning capacity) while having a reliable and responsive way to control the unit which will deal with upsets and other changes which affect the units coke make.</p>

EP	0605418	B1	2000-07-05	en	DESCR	1	<heading id="h0001"><u>Technical Field</u></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to computer data systems for storing and forwarding messages and, more particularly to an adaptation of existing worldwide Automated Teller Machine ("ATM") and Point of Sale ("POS") systems that permits users of such systems to receive and send electronic mail.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>Background Art</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Over the years, many different types of electronic message transmission devices have been developed. For transmitting spoken messages, one of the oldest, most widely used and convenient of these devices is the telephone. However, until quite recently, the telephone provided only live, real-time communication. Recently, "voice mail" services have become available that permit callers to leave spoken messages for later retrieval and reproduction to their intended recipients. While convenient, the cost of transmitting voice messages over the public phone system is relatively high in comparison with the cost of transmitting messages using surplus capacity that is available in communication systems that have been installed and are maintained in continuous operation for entirely different purposes.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Another recently developed message transmission technology is one with the ability to transmit text messages for later retrieval and reproduction by their intended recipient. Such systems are known as electronic mail and utilize an underlying technology known as a "Store And Forward Message Switch". However, most current electronic mail systems are both expensive and must be accessed using special purpose terminals. Presently, there exists no widely available means by which the public can conveniently and inexpensively access electronic mail communication.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Yet other recently developed communication systems are the many independently operated ATM systems and POS systems. One of the characteristics of the various ATM and POS systems is<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> their interconnection by many clearing house networks. These clearing house networks pass transactions back and forth between terminals on one ATM or POS system and another ATM or POS system on which the user's account identification records reside.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">It appears desirable to link parts of existing communication systems to provide readily accessible public electronic mail communication that frees users from the need to use a special purpose terminal. Such a combined system facilitates sending and receiving electronic mail and also provides much greater functionality to the exiting voice and data communication systems.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">In "Review of the Electrical Communication Laboratories" Vol. 32 (1984) Nov, N &amp;, Tokyo, Japan, pages 1036-1043 there is described a method of distributing cryptographic keys to aid in the encryption and decryption of messages over an e-mail network.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In "Nachrichtentechnische Zeitschriften" Vol. 36 (1983) Aug.; n8, Berlin, Deutschland, pages 500-504, there is described a means for encrypting communications thereby providing security on videotext networks.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Both of these known procedures employ network facilities, including user identity verification and data security facilities to enable services like message delivery and data-base access to be used. In<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> particular, the second document discloses the use of such services in a POS system.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">An object of the present invention is to provide a convenient means by which the public can readily avail themselves of electronic mail services. Another object of the present invention is to provide an economical system for public access to electronic mail services.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Another object of the present invention is to provide a secure system for public access to electronic mail services.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a highly reliable system for public access to electronic mail services.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Briefly, the present invention provides an electronic mail system by which users can easily authorise, generate and capture messages and responses. The system uses a debit card, a credit card or other machine readable personal identification card in conjunction with an authorised personal identification number ("PIN") or other valid password security identification to regulate access to the electronic mail service. The system of the present invention employs unique peripherals in conjunction with parts of existing communications networks and devices to provide simple text communications to remote locations. It provides this service by means of a structured link between a store and forward message switch and other<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> already installed communication systems. The system of the<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> present invention advantageously uses the existing networks of ATM and POS terminals together with the clearing house networks that interconnect the various ATM and POS systems to provide wide public access to electronic mail services.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">To access this electronic mail service, a user enters their debit, credit, or identification card into either an ATM or POS terminal. That terminal in conjunction with a local processor acquires the user's identity, the user's security information, and the user's desire to retrieve or enter messages. The local ATM or POS processor then passes this information through a processor for the ATM or POS institution to the information processor at the user's financial institution. It is also possible, based on the current state of the art of ATM and POS network systems, that the approval process may take place during an alternate account transaction processing step. This is described in more detail below. Upon receipt of this information, the processor for the user's financial institution confirms the user's identity and authorizes the user to access the electronic mail service. Such identification and authorization procedures are a routine operation on ATM and POS networks.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">After a user's access to the electronic mail system has been approved by their financial institution, a clearing house processor for the ATM and/or POS networks permits the user to access its electronic mail message service control function. This message service control function differentiates among the various transactions involved in electronic mail communication that are in addition to the financial transactions normally exchanged over the ATM or POS network. The message service control function performed by the clearing house processor also tracks the status and steps required to complete electronic mail transmission.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The message service control function on the clearing house processor passes user entered electronic mail control information to a special purpose store and forward message switch for retrieving the user's messages and/or permitting the user to originate or transmit messages to other users. The store and forward message switch then returns messages and/or verification<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> of status of messages for other users back through the message service control function of the clearing house processor for transmission back to the user at the ATM or POS terminal. The clearing house processor also separately passes accounting information to the user's financial institution for recording usage of the electronic mail services.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>Brief Description of Drawings</u></heading><p id="p0016" num="0016">Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following specification which, in association with the attached drawing figures and claims, describe the invention.

The electronic mail system 10 illustrates a generic Automated Teller Machine or Point of Sale ("ATM/POS") system within the dashed line 12. The generic ATM/POS system 12 includes an ATM/POS subsystem enclosed within the dashed line 14, an ATM data communication network 16, and an ATM institution processor 18.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The ATM/POS subsystem 14 depicted in FIG. 1 illustrates different techniques routinely employed for connecting various types of ATM terminals 22 and 24 and ATM/POS terminals 26 and 28 to the ATM data communication network 16. In the ATM/POS subsystem 14 depicted in FIG. 1 each of the ATM terminals 22 and 24 include their own microprocessor as depicted in FIG. 2. Consequently, because the terminals 22 and 24 include their own microprocessor, each terminal 22 or 24 is individually capable of communicating directly with the ATM data communication network 16. Alternatively, ATM/POS terminals 26 and 28 illustrate a different technique in which the terminals 26 and 28 are connected to a shared processor 32 through which they communicate with the ATM data communication network 16. The ATM/POS subsystem 14 illustrated in FIG. 1 also depicts a POS terminal 34 that communicates with a POS institution processor 36 via a POS data communication network 38.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Because of the similarities among different ATM systems and POS systems when they are incorporated into the electronic mail system 10, for purposes of this disclosure it is possible to illustrate both of these different types of systems by means of a single generic ATM/POS system 12. - If the generic ATM/POS system 12 of FIG. 1 were particularized to only an ATM system, then it would omit the POS terminal 34, the POS processor 36, and the POS data communication network 38, while the ATM/POS terminals 26 and 28 would communicate via the shared processor 32 only with the ATM data communication network 16. The<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> ATM/POS system 12 enclosed within its dashed line, when so particularized to only an ATM system, allows a user to perform financial transactions with only the institution(s) whose records reside on the ATM institution processor 18.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Alternatively, if the generic ATM/POS system 12 of FIG. 1 were particularized to only a POS system, then it would omit the ATM terminals 22 and 24, the ATM data communication network 16, and the ATM institution processor 18, while the ATM/POS terminals 26 and 28 would communicate via the shared processor 32 only with the POS data communication network 38. The ATM/POS system 12 enclosed within its dashed line, when so particularized to an POS system, allows a user to make transactions with only the merchant(s) whose records reside on the POS institution processor 36.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">In the illustration of FIG. 1, the shared processor 32 communicates only with the ATM data communication network 16 if the ATM/POS system 12 is particularized to an ATM system. Alternatively, if the ATM/POS system 12 is particularized to a POS system the shared processor 32 communicates only with the POS data communication network 38. The illustration in FIG. 1 of the shared processor 32 as being connected both to the ATM data communication network 16 and to the POS data communication network 38 presently does not exist in any known system. The shared processor 32 is so illustrated in the generic ATM/POS system 12 of FIG. 1 solely for pedagogical reasons to simplify FIG. 1 and to permit it to illustrate the characteristics common to both ATM and POS systems that are relevant to the present invention.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The electronic mail system 10 of the present invention envisions a plurality of independently operated ATM/POS systems 12 all intercommunicating simultaneously to provide the entire electronic mail service available to users. A clearing house data communication network 42 interconnects the plurality of ATM institution processors 18 and the plurality of POS institution processors 36 included in the electronic mail system 10 to a clearing house network processor 44. By transferring information among different ATM institution processors 18 operated by various financial institutions and<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> among different POS institution processor 36 operated by various merchants, the clearing house data communication network 42 and the clearing house network processor 44 allow users to perform inter-institution transactions such as between one of the ATM/POS systems 12 and a processor 46 operated by a user's financial institution.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">With the electronic mail system 10 as thus far described, a user begins to receive or transmit electronic mail using the ATM/POS system 12, the clearing house data communication network 42, the clearing house network processor 44, and the user's financial institution processor 46 by inserting a debit or credit card 48 into one of the terminals 22, 24, 26, 28 or 34 operated by one of the plurality of ATM/POS systems 12 included in the electronic mail system 10. Upon insertion of the card 48, the terminal 22, 24, 26, 28 or 36, in conjunction with the local microprocessor, acquires the user's identity and the user's security information. After the user enters a personal identification number ("PIN") or other security password or code, the terminal 22, 24, 26 28 or 34 communicates through its own ATM data communication network 16 and ATM institution processor 18 (or through its own POS data communication network 38 and POS institution processor 36), and the clearing house data communication network 42 with the clearing house network processor 44. The clearing house network processor 44 then interacts with the user's financial institution processor 46 through the clearing house data communication network 42 to access the user's account records, to obtain authorization for the user to access the electronic mail function of the electronic mail system 10, and to acquire appropriate information for charging such use to the user. As mentioned above, this approval process may take place during an alternate processing step and is described in further detail below. In authorizing usage of the electronic mail system 10, the user's financial institution processor 46 returns a message identification ("I.D.") for the user to the clearing house network processor 44.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Having received the user's message I.D. the clearing house network processor 44 then activates its message service control<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> function to access, via the clearing house data communication network 42, information stored for the user on a store and forward message switch 52. Via the clearing house data communication network 42 and the ATM/POS system 12, the store and forward message switch 52 then sends a group of messages (one transaction) back to the terminal 22, 24, 26, 28 or 34 at which the user entered his request. After completing this transaction, the store and forward message switch 52 updates a status code for the messages delivered to indicate that they have been sent and are awaiting further instructions from the user as to final disposition.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">By interacting with the terminal 22, 24, 26, 28 or 34 through a keyboard and/or function keys illustrated in FIG. 2, a user directs the ATM/POS subsystem 14 to display the retrieved messages on a display screen, also illustrated in FIG. 2. Using the keyboard and/or function keys of the terminal 22, 24, 26, 28 or 34, the user may request that the terminal 22, 24, 26, 28, or 34 print a copy of a retrieved message on paper 54.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The user may respond to or originate messages for storage on the store and forward message switch 52 using the terminal 22, 24, 26, 28 or 34 in the same manner as requesting access to stored messages. The electronic mail system 10 authorizes a user to respond to or originate messages in the same way as described above for retrieving messages. If the ATM/POS subsystem 14 possesses the ability to retain the user's identity and security code information, it is unnecessary for the user to reinsert the debit or credit card 48 and to reenter the security code. A response or a message to be stored on the store and forward message switch 52 may be entered at the terminal 22, 24, 26, 28 or 34 in a variety of different ways. For example, using an ATM/POS subsystem of the type depicted in FIG. 2, the user could respond to or enter a message using either a keyboard or a "pen pad." Alternatively, the terminal 22, 24, 26, 28 or 34 may include an optical character recognition unit (not illustrated in FIG. 2.) to scan a written message 56. A response or new message entered by the user at the terminal 22, 24, 26, 28 or 34 passes through the clearing<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> house network processor 44 to the user's financial institution processor 46 which must authorize the response or message's storage on the store and forward message switch 52.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Then the store and forward message switch 52 receives a response or a message, it validates the basics of the message, and if they are acceptable, stores the response or message for retransmission. Furthermore, the store and forward message switch 52 provides an acknowledgement to the terminal 22, 24, 26, 28 or 34 that the response or message has been stored. If the store and forward message switch 52 determines that a response or a message is unacceptable, in the same way it transmits a rejection message back to the terminal 22, 24, 26, 28 or 34 together with an explanation of the problem. In addition to the preceding way in which various parts of the electronic mail system 10 of the present invention intercommunicate as described above, the present invention also envisions pathways, other than the clearing house data communication network 42 and the clearing house network processor 44, by which ATM/POS systems 12 may communicate with the user's financial institution processor 46 and the store and forward message switch 52. For example, if the electronic mail system 10 implements the message service control function somewhere other than on the clearing house network processor 44, then the ATM institution processor 18 or the POS institution processor 36 may obtain authorization and other information necessary for a user to access the electronic mail system 10 by communicating directly with the user's financial institution processor 46 via a user authorization data communication network 62. Under such circumstances, the ATM institution processor 18 or the POS institution processor 36 can also exchange user messages directly with the store and forward message switch 52 via a message data communication network 64. Properly implemented, any of the various data communication networks 42, 62 or 64 can provide the message transmission capability necessary for proper operation of the electronic mail system 10.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Generally, messages are presented to the store and forward message switch 52 from outside the ATM/POS system 12 by a<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> computer terminal entry station 72. The station 72 may be any of several types of terminals that can communicate with electronic mail services. The station 72 could be a standard personal computer ("PC") with the message being created off-line and then transmitted to the store and forward message switch 52. Alternatively, the station 72 could be a terminal connected directly to a mainframe or mini-computer system.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The station 72 communicates with the store and forward message switch 52 via a message entry data communication network 74. In storing a message on the store and forward message switch 52, the station 72 identifies the user, either through a directory as normally provide by this type of service, or by knowing the user's electronic mail I.D. Directory services of this type are well known and are associated with many of the current electronic mail systems. A modem 76 may also communicate with the message entry data communication network 74 to provide the electronic mail system 10 with a pager communication service 78 and a facsimile transmission machine 82.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The present invention also envisions other ways of storing messages on the store and forward message switch 52. For example, using a telephone 84 individuals without access to an E-Mail Service may call a service bureau that has a station 72 connected to the electronic mail system 10. Such a service bureau will be able to take messages from outside individuals by telephone and store them on the store and forward message switch 52. Similarly, the user can also send messages out to individuals who lack an I.D. on the electronic mail system 10 through a service bureau. Anyone with a phone or mailing address can, in principle, be reached by sending a message to the service bureau for forwarding to the individual with which the user wants to communicate. Such operations would be a normal part of the service bureau function to extend the reach of the message service to the general public.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Another way of communicating with individuals who are not themselves users of the electronic mail system 10 is through the facsimile transmission machine 82. The store and forward message switch 52 recognizes when the user enters a facsimile<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> telephone number as the destination address for a response or a message. Under such circumstances, the store and forward message switch 52 initiates a telephone call and uses the conventional facsimile transmission process to deliver the message to the intended recipient. After successful facsimile transmission of the message, the message's status is displayed to the user.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Furthermore, the electronic mail system 10 may announce to users that a message has been stored for them on the store and forward message switch 52. To announce the storage of a message, the store and forward message switch 52 places a telephone call to the pager communication service 78 thereby activating the user's beeper. Upon being notified of a message's storage, the user proceeds to a terminal 22, 24, 26, 28 or 34 to retrieve it.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The link created by the store and forward message switch 52 also allows connection to multiple external E-Mail systems through the industry standard X.400 or custom E-Mail to E-Mail links. Such E-Mail links have already been established by many of these services and are well known in the art. This allows easy physical connection to all of the existing E-Mail services, and provides handy communication to users of the electronic mail system 10 from outside the ATM/POS systems. Generally, all of the standard services provided by the E-Mail system will be the same, and will be available through the electronic mail system 10. However, due to the physical limitations which may practically be imposed on the electronic mail system 10, the scope of the message may be limited in some way. For example such limitations may include, but are not limited to, the size or the detail of the message, or similar limitations.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">An additional feature of the electronic mail system 10 for individuals who themselves are not users of the system 10 is its ability to capture charge information instead of the normal E-Mail system charges that would be appropriate for those with E-Mail service access. This charge capture capability is a necessary part of providing easy service bureau access to the electronic mail system 10.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><heading id="h0005"><u>The Processor That Performs the</u> <u>Message Service Control Function</u></heading><p id="p0035" num="0035">The message service control function, described in greater detail below in connection with FIG. 5, is an essential part of the electronic mail system 10 of the present invention.

The communications controller 110 includes an input buffer 112 and an output buffer 114. Within the ATM/POS subsystem 14, the communications controller 110 provides data contained in transactions received from the data communication network 16 or 18 from its input buffer 112 to an input 118 of a microprocessor 120.

The input/output console 130 also includes various output devices including a display screen 152, an instruction panel and screen 154, and a status panel 156 that all receive data from the output buffer 134. The status panel 156 may include a number of indicators to inform a user of the various states (or status) of a transaction being performed including problems or errors that are likely to arise. These can be problems encountered by (or status of) the terminal 22, 24, 26, 28 or 34, the microprocessor 120, or errors or status communicated to the ATM/POS subsystem 14 from the processor 18, 36, 44 or 46 or from the store and forward message switch 52.

The OCR subsystem 170 includes a camera control function 176 that receives data from the output buffer 172 and transmits data to the input buffer 174. The camera control function 176 exchanges control and status signals with a document receiver 182 and a camera 184. The document receiver 182 supplies status signals to the camera 184.

The flow chart 230 sets forth the various functions performed by the institution processor 18 or 36 which are uniquely required for the operation of the electronic mail system 10. As depicted in the flow chart 230, the first operation performed for every message transaction processed by the institution processor 18 or 36 is a log transaction for recovery function 232. The log transaction for recovery function 232 is a standard function executed by the institution processor 18 or 36 of various different ATM/POS systems 12 in processing standard ATM or POS transactions. The only change needed in the log transaction for recovery functions 232 on existing ATM/POS systems 12 to accommodate the operation of the electronic mail system 10 is adding new record formats for message transactions to those already established for ATM or POS transactions.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">If the message transaction received by the institution processor 18 or 36 is from a user at one of the terminals 22, 24, 26, 28 or 34 seeking initial access to the electronic mail system 10, the computer program performs a validate user function 234. The validate user function 234 is an existing capability included in all ATM/POS systems 12, though it is not always identified by a system or function name similar to that used here. This standard function remains essentially as it presently exists on the current ATM/POS systems 12, but new message oriented transaction types must be added to the present valid formats to support the electronic mail system 10. If the particular institution processor 18 or 36 that receives a user validation request from one of its terminal 22, 24, 26, 28 or 34 is able to verify the user's authority to access the electronic mail system 10 without communicating with the clearing house network processor 44, then the institution processor 18 or 36 performs a format external message request function 236.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The format external message request function 236 handles the special processing associated with message transactions that are unique to the electronic mail system 10. After the<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --> format external message request function 236 has been performed and the destination affiliation is identified, the transaction will be moved into the normal transaction processing by performing an insert message into output function 238. The insert message into output function 236 forwards the transaction to the appropriate destination which depends on where the message service control function processing occurs for this transaction. Specifically, the format external message request function 236 puts information in the proper format with the necessary structural parameters to allow continued processing by the ATM or POS network. This type of function is common in all state of the art ATM and POS networks.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">If the particular institution processor 18 or 36 that receives a user validation request is unable to verify the user's authority to access the electronic mail system 10, then it performs a query other financial institutions function 242. The start of the process for accessing another institution through the query other financial institutions function 242 is essentially the same as for all existing or similar transactions processed by the ATM/POS system 12 when the institution processor 18 or 36 is not that of the user's financial institution. Determining location and affiliation of the particular user's account is performed using the standard location/affiliation directory as described above.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">From this point the transaction will be handled differently if the message service control function is provided by the clearing house network processor 44, or by the user's financial institution processor 46. Once the transaction is processed for local functions, and the destination affiliation is identified, the transaction moves into the standard insert message into output function 238 for transmission to the clearing house network processor 44. The insert message into output function 238 forwards the transaction to the appropriate destination, depending on where message service control function occurs for this transaction. The institution operating each ATM/POS system 12 may choose where it wishes to process message transactions for users being served by its<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> terminals 22, 24, 26, 28 and 34 if alternative message service control functions exist.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The standard receive messages or timeout function 252 already performed by existing ATM/POS systems 12 need only be modified to handle all normal message transactions for the electronic mail system 10. After the transaction has been processed by the receive messages or timeout function 252, it then proceeds to a format messages for terminal function 254 that performs the formatting required for messages of the electronic mail system 10. The format messages for terminal function 254 uses information provided by the message service control function, the user's account profile, and the store and forward message switch 52 to format the message for presentation to the user at the specific terminal 22, 24, 26, 28 or 34 now serving the user.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The response as prepared by the format messages for terminal function 254 is then transferred to a transmit response to terminal function 256 that is a standard function already performed by the institution processor 18 or 36. The present transaction and data exchange protocol performed by the transmit response to terminal function 256 need be modified from that on existing ATM/POS systems 12 only to the extent necessary to process the message transaction formats unique to the electronic mail system 10. The transmit response to terminal function 256 transfers the formatted data to the insert message into output function 238 for transmission to the appropriate one of the terminals 22, 24, 26, 28 or 34.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">Once the user has entered a valid PIN and has been approved by the system, multiple transactions can be carried out without the need to reenter a PIN and be re-approved by the system.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the ATM/POS system of the present invention will make use of the standard error functions currently available on ATM/POS networks in the prior art.

Specifically, security comes from the requirement that a user enter a debit/credit card 48 and security code for each transaction, or by relying on the ATM's ability to retain such information once it has been validated in a preceding transaction. After this user security information has been transmitted to the appropriate institution processor 18, 36 or 46 for verification, that processor's normal error or acceptance procedure occurs. If there is an error, or the user's logon is invalid, the existing normal error process and messages occur.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">If the user is authorized to access the electronic mail system 10, a Transaction Authorization number is created for the transaction in the same fashion as for all other ATM/POS financial transactions, and processing is allowed to continue. The Transaction Authorization number that is generated for system security purposes in the operation of the electronic mail system 10 uses the standard algorithm and process presently used in ATM/POS systems. That Transaction Authorization number serves the same purpose for message transaction as for all other types of transactions occurring in ATM/POS systems 12.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">The basic audit trail and recovery oriented processes in the ATM/POS network are not disturbed by the modifications needed to operate the electronic mail system 10.

The electronic mail service choice guides the user through a sequence of steps that allows the creation or retrieval of messages. The electronic mail system 10 also automatically notifies users if messages are waiting for them, without any action required other than the user accessing the ATM/POS system 12 through the terminal 22, 24, 26, 28 or 34.

EP	0608223	B1	2000-03-08	en	DESCR	1	<p id="p0001" num="0001">This invention relates to bandages. In particular, it relates to a bandage which provides flexibility of use and extended scope of application over bandages presently available.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">US-A-2 096 564 discloses a bandage comprising a flexible strip of tape having an adhesive undersurface and provided with a plurality of spaced rows of elongated apertures.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Existing bandages are typically in the form of a strip which is stored in a roll, or in the form of a tube. The tube may be shaped to conform to the particular location at which it is to be used, for example at the ankle joint. A tube, or sleeve, is generally a more convenient form than a strip since it is quick and relatively easy to apply, although its shape and size limit the scope of application.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Depending on the circumstances of use, a sleeve, in particular, may suffer the following disadvantages:-<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>i) it nay be unduly restrictive to movement in a certain direction in which free movement is preferable;</li><li>ii) it may not provide sufficient support, allowing too much movement in a certain direction or directions in which restricted movement is preferable;</li><li>iii) it may be uncomfortable and, in particular, may not fit adequately;</li><li>iv) it may tend to kink when the joint is flexed; or</li><li>v) it may cover an area which needs to remain open or accessible, such as a wound or bed sore.</li></ul></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">According to the invention, there is provided a bandage comprising a flexibly stretchable first member formed of an elastic layer covered on at least one surface by a woven material which is provided with lines or areas of weakness, and a second member formed of a base material less elastic than the first member or inelastic, the second member having upstanding hooked elements for engaging the woven material of the first member; whereby to provide for controlled flexibility over predetermined<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> areas of the first member upon engagement therewith.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The first member may be easily extensible and the lines or areas of weakness may be local in extent. Such lines or areas of weakness provide means for controlling the stretching of the first member in diverse local areas and in specific directions according to the requirements of a particular application. Lines or areas of weakness are preferably slits or cuts only partially through the first member, but may be made through the entire thickness of the first member. The lines or areas of weakness may be introduced in situ and/or during manufacture. Lines of weakness are preferably generally parallel to the longitudinal axis of the limb to be bandaged. The bandage may thus be adapted to allow easy movement in specific areas and in specific directions since the first member will stretch in a direction generally normal to each slit. The use of a series of lines of weakness in the form of a lattice allows stretching in all directions.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In a preferred embodiment, the areas of weakness may be apertures which allow access to a wound site, for example, or which prevent wrinkling of the bandage during flexing of a joint.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The second member provides means for fastening the bandage when the hooked elements engage woven material of the first bandage.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">One or more pieces of the second member may be used to strengthen the bandage by limiting or preventing stretching of the first member.

In this manner inserts may be located on either side of the first member as required.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The bandage is suitably manufactured in the form of a sheet, but preferably it is in the form of a tubular bandage of a particular joint shape. Strips of bandage may be obtained by cutting a sheet into the required length and/or width. Tubular bandages may also be made in situ by sealing the ends of a sheet of the first member with one or more strips of the second member. A sheet may thus be closed by the one or more strips of the second member so as to form a cylinder.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The bandage may have an adhesive layer on part or all of at least one surface of the first member. Such an adhesive layer would improve protection of damaged ligaments or structural tissue by adhering to the skin surface.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a bandage comprising: manufacturing a flexibly stretchable first member by providing a layer of elastic material, with a layer of woven material attached to at least one surface of said layer and cutting slits through part or all of the first member thus formed; and controlling the flexibility of the first member by fastening one or more pieces of a second member formed of a base material which is inelastic or less elastic than the first member to a predetermined area or areas of the first member by engaging hooked elements upstanding from the second member with the woven material of the first member.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Applications of the bandage the subject of the invention include:<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>i) circumstances where support is required, such as in the protection of damaged ligaments, where appropriately position inhibition means can be used;</li><li>ii) to hold impulse-compression pads inside a tubular bandage for local treatment of joints and tissues;</li><li>iii) where rapid and unskilled placement of dressings with localised pressure is required, such as for preventing the bleeding of a wound in an emergency;</li><li>iv) where ventilation of pressure sores or relief of pressure is required; and</li><li>v) in the constructions of an immobilisation cast for body or limb, with the addition of a quick-setting material such as an alginate or plaster of Paris.</li></ul></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The thickness of the bandage is not critical to the invention since it should be suited to the particular material used and the specific application envisaged.

Thus a bandage can be manufactured for application, not only for a particular site, but also for a particular purpose, and applied with speed and ease even by an unskilled person. Likewise, a bandage can be altered or adjusted before or during fitting to suit a special requirement. The bandage should conform to the particular application in that it must not compromise circulation.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The bandage and/or inhibition means may be colour-coded to indicate the degree to which they are elastic.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none"><li>Fig 1 is a schematic transverse section of a bandage according to the invention;</li><li>Fig 2 is a schematic plan view of another bandage according to the invention;</li><li>Fig 3 is a schematic transverse section of the bandage of Fig 2 viewed in direction A-A;</li><li>Fig 4 is a schematic plan view of a further bandage according to the invention;</li><li>Fig 5 is a schematic plan view of a stretched section of the bandage of Fig 4; and</li><li>Fig 6 is a schematic side view of a yet further bandage according to the invention.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In Fig 1, there is shown a bandage 10 comprising a first member 20 and a second member 30. The first member 20 has a layer 40 with a covering layer on each side, the first member 20 being provided with areas or lines of weakness preferably in the form of slits as will be described more clearly in later embodiments of the invention. The covering layer on one side provides a comfort layer 55 for contact with the body and may also be used for location of inflation pads by a further second member. The covering layer 50 on the other side is engaged by hooked elements 70 extending from layer 60 of the second member 30. Layer 40 is an elastic material such as Neoprene with covering layers 50 and 55 being woven material. In use the woven material 50, 55 is attached to the elastic material 40 during manufacture, by adhesive for example, so that the first member 20 can be stretched around the part of the body to be bandaged. Layer 60 is less elastic than the first member or may be inelastic, being a moulded plastics material for example. In use, the hooked, elements 70 engage the woven material 50, preventing stretching of first member 20 at the points of attachment.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Figs 2 and 3 show an embodiment in which a bandage 100 has slits 180, 185 cut in its first member 120, and an aperture 190. Slits 180 are partial thickness, being cut through the woven material 150 only. Slits 185 are full thickness, being cut through both layers of the first member 120, comprising woven material 150 and elastic material 140 only in this embodiment.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Strips of inelastic material 165 are provided for securing the bandage and pieces of inelastic material 160 is placed around the aperture 190 so as to provide a local inelastic region which prevents unwanted deformation of the bandage.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Second member pieces 160, 165 may be Velcro<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> (registered trade mark) or other similar inelastic material having hooked elements. The first member is, for example, wetsuit material, which may be 3 mm Neoprene lined with a 0.5 mm thick woven material. It will be appreciated that other materials could be used. In particular woven material 150 could be a piled fabric, such as plush, or could have looped elements which engage with the hooked elements 170.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In use, sheets of bandage 100 are placed around the part of the body to be bandaged and are secured in place by strips of inelastic material 165. Slits 180 in the sheet provide lines of weakening, so that the sheet stretches generally normal to these lines. Instead of being manufactured as a sheet, the bandage may be manufactured in the form of a tube. In this case, slits are provided around arcs of the circumference of inelastic material. Unwanted slits may be sealed by strips of pieces of inelastic material. Further strips of inelastic material may be positioned where extra support or strengthening is required, such as along damaged ligaments or across incompletely healed fractures.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">This example uses inelastic material for securing or strengthening, but it is possible to use material which is less elastic than that of the first member.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">In another embodiment of the invention, the slits in the first member 120 of the bandage of Fig 3 are in the form of multiple slits 280 arranged in a "bricked" layout in the bandage 200 illustrated in Fig 4. These slits 280 deform when stretched around a limb during application as shown in Fig 5. The multiple slits become a lattice of diamond shapes 285 when stretched as indicated by the arrows. The use of this form enables stretching in all directions. Improved stretching is thereby achieved over the whole of the lattice region.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The bandage 200 may be closed by a longitudinal strip of the second member 265 to form a tubular bandage.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The slits are generally closely spaced along the longitudinal axis of the limb to be supported. This weakens the force exerted by the first member so that by itself it exerts only minor constricting force or the limb.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Fig 6 shows an embodiment in which the bandage according to the invention has been manufactured in the form of a tubular support bandage 30 and shaped to conform to a knee joint. Slits 380 have been cut in the first member of the bandage in the region where stretching is required and have deformed to a diamond lattice. Further support to ligaments, for instance, is provided in the form of inelastic or less elastic regions obtained by the addition of strips of the second member 330. If necessary, an aperture 390 can prevent wrinkling of the bandage, the aperture being maintained in shape by a piece of the second member 360. The strips 330 may also be used to close a slit 380 if it is not required.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">A versatile bandage and method of manufacturing a bandage have thus been provided which provide quick and easy application without the requirement of a large range of custom-fit bandages.</p>

EP	0612463	B2	2000-05-24	en	DESCR	1	<p id="p0001" num="0001">The invention concerns a device for formation of a film on the walls of small holes in boards for printed circuits.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">A device for the formation of such films, according to the preamble of claim 1, is disclosed in EP-A-0 424 798. The circuit boards are immersed in a special bath so that a protective or antioxidizing film, or some film to improve surface quality, may be formed on said boards and especially on the walls of the holes bored through them. The components of said bath determine chemical reactions on the copper surfaces forming what is known as chemical tin or chemical copper or other products.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In mass production methods the boards follow each other through the bath moved along by some means of transport. This is clearly a lengthy process partly because the film deposited must be as uniform as possible.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The major difficulty arises over forming the film on the walls of the very small holes made in these boards since passage of the liquid through them is hindered by their minute diameters and also because their walls lie orthogonally<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> to the direction in which the boards move especially if this movement is parallel to their greater surfaces.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">While the horizontal disposition of the boards may be optimum from the structural and functional standpoints, it does not facilitate action by gravity of the chemical agents on the sides of the above holes which, as said above, lie orthogonally to the surfaces of the boards.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Purpose of the present invention is to shorten working times and also to ensure the best possible formation of film inside the holes, as will be explained below.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Subject of the invention is a device for forming a film on the walls of small holes bored in printed circuit boards by immersion of said boards in a tank containing a specific liquid product.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">One or more sets of nozzles, orthogonal to board movement, are placed in the tank in a position corresponding to that of the boards, said tank also containing a pump that continually takes up liquid and returns it to the bath under pressure applied through said nozzles.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In this way currents of liquid are made to flow through said holes.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The chemical reaction between the bath's components and the copper sides of the holes can result in formation of a film of chemical tin, chemical copper or of some other substance, as the case may be.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A special mechanism causes the boards to move along continuously on a level parallel to their greater surface and to the free surface of the liquid.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Preferably the tank contains sets of 'suction' nozzles through which liquid is taken from the bath, said sets<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> alternating with other sets of pressure nozzles, also orthogonal to movement of the boards and in a position corresponding to that of said boards, through which second responding to that of said boards, through which second set the liquid is returned to the bath.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Entry point of a pump is connected to the suction nozzles and its exit point to the pressure nozzles.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The nozzles of each set are fed on a plane which is orthogonal and transversal to movement of the boards.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In this way currents of liquid, alternating in one direction and in the opposite direction, will pass through the holes and in doing so speed up and improve formation of the desired film.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The nozzles consist of thin rectangular openings, each set being aligned transversally to the direction in which the boards move, the purpose of this being to set up laminar currents transversal to this movement.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In one execution each set of nozzles consists of several longitudinal slit-like mouths, placed along the top of horizontal cylindrical tubes.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">These tubes are parallel, transversal to movement of the boards, some being joined by vertical connections to a longitudinal tube fixed to the entry side of the pump, and others to another tube, parallel to the first one, fixed to the exit side of the pump.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The invention offers some evident advantages. The currents of liquid in the tank flowing in opposite directions and passing back and forth inside the holes in the boards moving along the tank, increase the amount of movement between said liquid and the walls of the holes. This signifies an increase in the speed at which particles of liquid are deposited and in the chemical reactions that give rise to formation of film on the walls of said holes.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Not only does the invention achieve this but it also reduces costs of manufacturing printed circuits and improves their quality.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Characteristics and purposes of the invention will be made still clearer by the example of its execution here following illustrated by diagrammatic figures.</p><heading id="h0001"><u>Examples of execution</u></heading><p id="p0022" num="0022"><dl id="dl0001" compact="compact"><dt>Fig. 1</dt><dd>Perspective view of an apparatus for printed circuits with the device subject of the invention.</dd><dt>Fig. 2</dt><dd>Detailed view of the 'suction' nozzles.</dd><dt>Fig. 3</dt><dd>Detailed view of the pressure nozzles.</dd></dl></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The device 10 comprises the frame 11 and tank 12 for holding the liquid product 13 that gives a chemical reaction on the boards 20 of printed circuits.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Said boards 20 are made to slide on a horizontal geometrical plane, indicated by XX, by means of two sets of motor-driven wheels 21 and 22 one above and the other below said plane.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The sets of transversal parallel manifolds 30 and 31, respectively alternated, are placed at established intervals below said plane XX.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Aligned on the upper side of said manifolds are the rectangular nozzles, 32 and 33 respectively.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The manifolds 30 are joined by connections 28 to the longitudinal tube 34 while manifolds 31 are joined by connections 29 to the longitudinal tube 35 parallel to the first one.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The tube 34 is connected to the exit side 36 of the pump 50 while the tube 35 is connected to the entry side 37 of said pump.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">By means of this pump the liquid 13 contained in the tank 12 is continually recycled since it is sucked up through<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the nozzles 32 and returned through nozzles 33 with the current 40 flowing upward and thus towards the printed circuit boards 20, and the current 41 caused by said boards to flow downward.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Penetration of said current 40 inside the holes 42 in the printed circuit boards and current 41 flowing out from said holes 42, increases the movement of liquid in relation to the walls of the holes and this in turn increases and potentiates the chemical reaction that leads to gradual formation of the film 43, especially of chemical tin or chemical copper on said walls.</p>

EP	0615422	B1	2000-01-19	en	DESCR	1	<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to the measurement of blood pressure and, more specifically, to the determination of mean left atrial blood pressure. Many invasive methods of determining mean left atrial pressure are known, but the invention aims to provide a less invasive technique (without requiring puncturing of an artery) for monitoring mean left atrial pressure.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">US-A-4,409,986 discloses an esophageal cardiac pulse probe for monitoring cardiac pulse wave forms. The apparatus is intended for monitoring sounds from the heart and lungs, but is not disclosed as being suitable for measuring mean left atrial pressure. The apparatus comprises a sensing probe including and inflatable balloon, means for inserting said sensing probe into an esophogus, and inflation means for inflating said ballon and means for measuring the balloon pressure.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The invention provides apparatus as set out in Claim 1,</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Thus, the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> invention seeks to non-invasively and easily obtain a determination of a person's mean left atrial transmural pressure.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In order to non-invasively determine a person's mean left atrial pressure safely, accurately, and reliably, in accordance with the present invention a balloon is inserted into the person's esophagus and positioned adjacent the left atrium and inflated, and the mean balloon pressure is measured when the amplitude of balloon pressure oscillations effected by the left atrial pressure is at a peak. This peak amplitude is indicative of resonating of the balloon pressure at a pressure effected by the person's mean left atrial pressure, in accordance with the oscillometric principle. This pressure is thus determinative approximately of mean left atrial pressure. The mean left atrial transmural pressure may be determined by subtracting therefrom the pleural pressure, i.e., the pressure on the outside of the heart. It is envisioned that further refinements of this method may lead to the ability to determine other left atrial pressure values such as diastolic and systolic left atrial pressures or other pressures associated therewith.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The above and other aims, features, and advantages of the present invention will be apparent in the following description, provided purely by way of example, when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which like reference numerals denote the same or similar parts throughout the several views.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In the drawings:-<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>Fig. 1 is a side view of a combination of a balloon-containing catheter and an<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> electrode-containing catheter in accordance with the present invention with the balloon inflated;</li><li>Fig. 2 is an enlarged side sectional view of the balloon of Fig. 1;</li><li>Fig. 3 is a partial left lateral sectional view of the human body taken along the mid-sagittal plane and showing the balloon of Fig. 1 within the esophagus and adjacent the left atrium of the heart;</li><li>Fig. 4 is a front sectional view of the human body illustrating the position of the heart</li><li>Fig. 5 is a top sectional view of the human body, taken along lines 5-5 of Fig. 4, at the level of the seventh thoracic vertebra and with the balloon of Fig. 1 in the esophagus :</li><li>Fig. 6 is a schematic view of apparatus, including the balloon-containing catheter of Fig. 1, which embodies the present invention;</li><li>Fig. 7 is a pressure trace of the left atrial pressure during one cardiac cycle as sensed by the balloon of Fig. 1 when adjacent the left atrium;</li><li>Fig. 8 is a graph of an esophageal electrocardiogram of the left atrium during one cardiac cycle;</li><li>Fig. 9 is a pressure trace of an unfiltered signal of balloon pressure with respiratory and cardiac effected oscillations when the balloon of Fig. 1 is adjacent the left atrium, as the balloon is gradually pressurized;</li><li>Fig. 10 is a pressure trace of mean balloon pressure for the pressure trace of Fig. 1;</li><li>Fig. 11 is a pressure trace of amplified cardiac signal on a steady baseline which signal is derived from the balloon pressure trace of Fig. 9 and covers the same time period as that of Figs. 9 and 10;</li><li>Fig. 12 is a graph of an electrocardiogram<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> taken simultaneously with the pressure traces of Figs. 9, 10 and 11;</li><li>Fig. 13 is a schematic view of an alternative embodiment of the present invention, it being understood that this embodiment is meant to include the portion of apparatus of FIg. 6 which is connected to line 60:</li><li>Fig. 14 is a schematic view of an alternative embodiment of the present invention, it being understood that this embodiment is meant to include the portion of apparatus of Fig. 6 which is connected to line 60;</li><li>Fig. 15 is a view similar to that of Fig. 1 of the catheter apparatus of Fig. 14; and</li><li>Fig. 16 is a view similar to that of Fig. 3 of an alternative means for sensing position of an esophageal balloon adjacent the left atrium.</li></ul></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, there is illustrated generally at 19 catheter apparatus including a hollow catheter 20 comprising a length of flexible tubing 22 having a bore or lumen 23 and on one end of which is attached a balloon 24 for flow communication with the lumen 23 for pressurization of the balloon and for sensing the pressure thereof. An electrode 21 may be positioned just above the balloon 24 for obtaining an esophageal electrocardiogram and an electrical lead 25, within a second catheter 27, provided thereto, as will be discussed in greater detail hereinafter.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Referring to Fig. 3, there is illustrated the placement of the balloon 24 within the esophagus 26 of a human body for the purpose of sensing the mean pressure of the left atrium 28 of the heart 30. The catheter 20 is inserted balloon first through nasal<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> passage 32, pharynx 34, then into the esophagus 26. If desired, the balloon may alternatively be inserted through the mouth. As shown in Fig. 3, the outer wall of the left atrium 28 is adjacent and essentially in direct contact with the outer wall of the esophagus 26, and advantage is taken of this relationship to determine mean left atrium pressure by means of the balloon 24 thusly inserted non-invasively into the esophagus 26 and positioned therealong adjacent the left atrium so as to be sufficiently affected thereby to sense left atrium pressure, as will be discussed in greater detail hereinafter.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The tubing 22 may be composed of any suitable flexible, chemically inert, non-toxic material such as polyvinyl chloride for withstanding operating pressures without significant expansion. A preferred tubing is a Tygon® brand polyvinyl Chloride tubing having an inner diameter of approximately 1.3mm (0.050") which is a product of Cole-Parmer Instrument Co., 7425 North Oak Park Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60648-9930, as shown on page 636 of the Cole-Parmer 1989-90 Catalog. The tubing 22 has a suitable length which may be perhaps 80 cm. The tubing 22 may desirably have markings (not shown) along the length thereof to indicate distance therealong so that the balloon 24 may be initially positioned approximately adjacent the left atrium 28. The tubing may contain a portion 18 which extends over the length of the balloon 24 and a portion 15 which extends from the balloon. Portions 15 and 18 are connected by means of a stainless steel ferrule 44 over which the tubing is press fit. The distal end of the balloon is closing by plugging by a cylindrical plug 42 of stainless steel or the like over which tubing portion 18 is<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> press fit. At each balloon end, a sleeve 43 is fitted over the tubing portion 18 to provide a larger diameter for securing the balloon fabric. Each balloon end is then sealed by surgical thread 38 and/or silicone cement. A plurality of apertures 46 are provided in the tubing (portion 18) wall over a distance from the closed end 42 equal to less than the balloon length to provide flow communication between the tubing 22 and the interior of the balloon 24 for inflating the balloon and for sensing pressure therein. The balloon 24 fits over the tubing portion 18 containing the apertures 46 and is attached to the tubing 22 at end portion 42 and at ferrule or second portion 44 between which portions are the apertures 46, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Pressurization and sensing lines may be attached at the end 40, which is opposite the balloon end 42, as will be discussed in greater detail hereinafter.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">However, other suitable means may be used for such attachment. For example, the balloon may be fixed over the end of a catheter the end of which is plugged. The balloon 24 may be constructed of any suitable flexible non-toxic film which can withstand operating pressures without rupture or irreversible deformation. The balloon 24 may have a capacity of perhaps about 2 milliliters. When inflated within the pressure range for measuring mean left atrial pressure, the balloon 24 takes on a generally cylindrical shape, as illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2. The thickness of the material of which the balloon 24 is made is perhaps about 0.013mm (0.0005"). The balloon 24 should function properly in any rotational orientation around the longitudinal catheter axis. The balloon 24 may, for example, be constructed of low density polyethylene film such as Extrel® SF brand polyethylene film, a product of Exxon Chemical<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> Co., Polymers Group, Division of Exxon Corp., 351 North Oakwood Road, Lake Zurich, Illinois 60047-1562.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Referring to Figs. 4 and 5, it should be noted that the esophagus 26 is sandwiched between the left atrium 28 and the vertebral column 48 so that when the balloon 24 is positioned adjacent the left atrium 28 the vertebral column 48 acts similarly as an anvil for effective action of the left atrium pressure on the balloon 24 to affect the pressure therein as will be described hereinafter. The esophagus 26 is flanked by the left and right lungs 50 and 52 respectively. The aorta 54 is positioned generally between the esophagus 26 and the left lung 50 and in proximity to the vertebral column 48, as shown in Fig. 5.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Referring to Fig. 6, there is illustrated generally at 56 apparatus for pressurizing the balloon 24 and for sensing the pressure therein. For the purpose of precisely positioning the balloon 24 adjacent the left atrium 28, the balloon 24 is first statically filled with a predetermined quantity of perhaps 1.4 milliliter of air via syringe 58, with stop cock or valve 96 suitably open for passage of the air therefrom through line 60 to tubing 22 to which line 60 is suitably attached at the end portion 40.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The balloon pressure is transmitted from line 60 through line 62 to four-way stop cock or valve 64 which transmits the pressure through line 66 to one side 74 of the diaphragm 86 of a differential pressure transducer 68 and through line 70 to filter 72. Transducer 68 may, for example, be a Validyne model DP7 differential pressure transducer provided by Validyne Engineering Corp., 8626 Wilbur Avenue, Northridge, California 91324. Pressure from the<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> filter 72 is transmitted through line 76 and stop cock or valve 78 to the other side 80 of the transducer 68. The transducer 68 converts the net pressure signal acting on the diaphragm 86 to an electrical signal which is transmitted through line 82 to a first signal processor 84. Processor 84 may be any suitable conventional electronic signal processing circuit which amplifies and otherwise processes and conditions the electrical signal representations of pressure and communicates these signals to a display means 85 via line 87. Display means 85 may be a digital display, a strip chart recorder, a cathode ray tube, or any other suitable device for displaying or utilizing the signals from processor 84.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The balloon 24 will not only sense atrial pressure but will also record normal peristaltic waves from swallowing as well as pressure excursions from normal breathing. Peristaltic waves are easily distinguished by their high amplitude (up to 10 kPa (100 cm of water)) and relative infrequency and can therefore be ignored. Respiratory excursions (typically from - 1 kPa to + 1kPa (-10 to +10 cm of water)) at frequencies of 0.1 to 0.8 Hertz) can interfere with left atrial pressure wave form and measurement. They are therefore filtered out during signal processing as described hereinafter.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Filter 72 is a low pass mechanical filter such as, for example, a Nupro® micrometer needle valve connected as shown in Fig. 6, a product of Nupro Company of 4800 East 345th Street, Willoughby, Ohio 44094. The unprocessed signal carrying both the higher frequency cardiac wave form (generally 1.5 to 9.0 Hertz) effected by left atrial pressure and the lower frequency respiratory wave form (generally 0.1 to 0.8 Hertz) goes directly to the first side 74 of<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> the differential pressure transducer 68 via line 66. An identical signal is also transmitted to the variable control valve 72. By restricting an orifice (not shown) in filter 72, in accordance with principles commonly known to those of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention pertains, the balloon pressure wave is filtered to selectively pass the lower frequency component, which includes respiratory artifact, through line 76 and valve 78 to the other side 80 of the differential transducer 68, and the higher frequency component is excluded. This in effect allows the respiratory artifact arriving almost in phase on both sides of the transducer diaphragm 86 to cancel itself out so that the cardiac wave form is recovered and outputted as an electrical signal through line 82 to the first signal processor 84.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">With the balloon inflated, it is precisely positioned adjacent the left atrium 28 by moving it up or down the esophagus 26 by withdrawing or inserting the catheter 20 at the nose until a typical left atrial pressure wave form, illustrated at 88 in Fig. 7, is seen on the pressure trace from the first signal processor 84. As previously discussed, this wave form 88 comprises the balloon pressure signal with the lower frequency respiratory wave form filtered out. This wave form 88 may be confirmed as being a typical left atrial pressure wave form by comparison with a simultaneous esophageal electrocardiogram, illustrated at 140 in Fig. 8, which is recorded by a conventional electrocardiograph, illustrated at 92 in Fig. 6. Electrocardiogram 140 is obtained by the use of a stainless steel electrode, illustrated at 21, which is suitably attached to the catheter 20 just above the balloon 24. However, the electrode 21 may be<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> otherwise adjacent the balloon 24. For example, an electrode for this purpose could comprise conductive material on the surface of the balloon. An electrical lead 25 is attached to the electrode and extends within a second catheter 27 and to electrocardiograph 92 for transmitting the signals picked up by the electrode 21 for processing therein. The lead 25 may, for example, be silvered 30 AWG wire-wrapping wire provided by OK Industries, 4 Executive Plaza, Yonkers, New York 10701. The catheters 20 and 27 may be held together by suitable securing means such as, for example, cyclohexanone glue 16. Alternatively, a double-lumen catheter of pre-formed polyvinyl chloride may be used. The electrode 21 is preferably in the shape of a ring which encircles catheter tubing 22 so as to insure that it will be suitably positioned without interference by tubing 22 for sensing left atrial electrical activity. In accordance with conventional practice, it may be required that skin electrodes 94 also be hooked-up to the subject. The wave form 140 is characterized by a wave portion (which heralds atrial depolarization) which reaches a high voltage and becomes bi-phasic with a sharp upstroke and shows an intrinsicoid deflection. Thus, points A, C, and V, shown on wave form 88 in Fig. 7, are three essential components of the left atrial pressure wave, and these points are known to correspond to points P, R, and T respectively on the electrocardiogram 140 of Fig. 8 thus confirming that the wave form 88 is a typical left atrial pressure wave form.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">When, as the balloon and esophageal electrode are moved up and down the esophagus, a typical left atrial wave form, similar to wave form 88, is sensed on the pressure trace from the first signal<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> processor 84, which indicates that the balloon 24 is suitably positioned adjacent the left atrium 28, the balloon 24 is then fixed in place by applying tape over the catheter 20 and onto the upper lip just beneath the nose. The distinctiveness of this wave form, confirmed by use of electrode 21, may desirably reduce the level of skill required for proper positioning of the balloon. Alternatively, a conventional surface or skin electrocardiogram may be obtained, by use of electrodes 94 on the subject's body and wired to electrocardiograph 92, for comparison with wave form 88 to determine when the balloon is correctly positioned. However, the use of the esophageal electrocardiogram 140 for this purpose is considered preferable since it may provide a more distinctive wave form which is more easily recognized. The use of either the esophageal or skin electrodes for positioning the balloon is advantageously suitable for use with the wide range of body size from premature neonates to adult men.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Other means for suitably positioning the sensing balloon may alternatively be used. For example, as illustrated in Fig. 16, a positioning balloon 200 may be positioned on a catheter 210 to contact the esophago-gastric junction 204 at the stomach 212 of an adult and a sensing balloon 206 positioned on a separate catheter 202 (since the positioning balloon 200 must be inflated before inflation of the sensing balloon 206 is begun) and at a distance from the positioning balloon 200 which approximates the relatively constant distance, illustrated at 208, in an adult between the esophago-gastric junction 204 and the left atrium 28. This distance 208 is of course relatively constant in adults but not in premature neonates and infants.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">As previously discussed, the pressure wave form 88 is insufficient for determining mean left atrial pressure due to its amplitude being a function of the elasticity of the system, the amount of gas in the balloon, and the initial pressure within it, as well as the intra-atrial pressure and the surrounding tissue pressure. With the balloon 24 precisely positioned, processing can begin for accurately and non-invasively determining the mean left atrial pressure, as discussed hereinafter.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">After proper placement has been accomplished, sensing balloon 24 is initially evacuated to perhaps - 1 kPa to - 1.2 kPa (-10 to -12 cm of water) pressure, less than the minimum expected pressure to be measured, using syringe 58, with the stop cock 96 open thereto. This purges the system of any gas, prior to beginning a measurement, to insure consistency, accuracy, and reliability of pressure measurements. The system is similarly also purged of any residual gases between measurements.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">After the balloon 24 has been properly placed adjacent the left atrium 28 and evacuated, it is gradually inflated with air or another suitable inert gas such as, for example, nitrogen gas or a suitable liquid such as, for example, water for the purpose of determining mean left atrial pressure as hereinafter described. The use of a liquid may provide enhanced gain. If a liquid is used, it may be provided to line 60 by means of a liquid-filled syringe to which is attached a suitable mechanical or hydraulic pressurization device. The use of air may simplify the equipment and its use and may therefore be preferred for this purpose. A source of air under a sufficient pressure such as, for example, 276 kPa (40 psi) for inflating the balloon 24 is illustrated at 100. With stop cocks or valves 96<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> and 102 opened to connect the metering gas supply valve 98 with the line 60 and with syringe 58 closed to line 60 by valve 96, the gas from source 100 is routed through line 104 to the metering valve 98 where it is released to line 106 and through stop cocks 102 and 96 and line 60 to catheter 20 in metered quantity for gradually inflating the balloon 24. As used herein and in the claims, the term "line", unless otherwise specified, is meant to refer to tubing, a catheter, an electrically conductive wire, or other suitable means for transmitting a pressure or electrical signal. Valve 98 is a Nupro® brand micrometer needle valve, a product of Nupro Company of 4800 East 345th Street, Willoughby, Ohio 44094, which is constructed to allow a broad range of near constant flow rates against back pressures to a maximum of about 5 kPa (50 cm water or 0.74 psi). It is precalibrated to provide gas flows up to about 4 milliliters per minute on average. Other suitable valves may alternatively be provided. Metering valve 98 is thus opened to provide a suitable gas flow such as a flew of approximately 1.0 milliliter per minute for gradually filling the sensing balloon 24 at a constant rate.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">While not wishing to be bound by theory here or elsewhere in this specification, the following is believed to occur as the sensing balloon 24 is pressurized. The gradual filling of the sensing balloon 24 causes the pressure therein to increase at a generally slow steady rate which, in accordance with the theory of the previously discussed oscillometric effect, is affected by the atrial pressure causing oscillations therein as well as by respiratory waves. As the mean balloon pressure approaches the mean left atrial pressure, the atrial<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> pressure oscillations of balloon pressure increase in intensity or amplitude until the balloon pressure resonates maximally, i.e. reaches a peak amplitude, when the mean balloon pressure approximates the mean left atrial pressure. Thereafter, as the mean balloon pressure continues to increase, the amplitude of oscillations due to the atrial pressure decreases. More specifically, the balloon pressure oscillates maximally when its expansion has increased the pressure in the tissue surrounding the left atrium to the point where the mean tissue pressure equals mean left atrial pressure (MLAP).</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Figs. 9 to 12 are illustrations of four electronic displays or tracings used to record and display the absolute balloon pressure wave form 108 (Fig. 9), the mean balloon pressure wave form 110 (Fig. 10), the differential signal 112 with added gain from the signal processor 84 (Fig. 11), and a simultaneous electrocardiogram 114 (Fig. 12). Vertical line 116 in each of Figs. 9 to 12 represents the same point in time. A comparison of the electrocardiograms 140 and 114 in Figs. 8 and 12 respectively indicates that the time scale for Figs. 7 and 8 is greatly expanded relative to the time scale for Figs. 9 to 12, i.e., the wave form 140 in Fig. 8 covers a period of about a second, and a multitude of such waves over a multitude of seconds is shown in Fig. 12.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The absolute balloon pressure wave form 108 is obtained from a suitable transducer 118 connected to line 60 via line 120. The transducer 118 may, for example, be a Cobe CDX III transducer provided by Cobe Laboratories, Inc., 1185 Oak Street, Lakewood, Colorado 80215. The transducer 118 converts the balloon pressure signal in line 120 to an electrical signal which is transmitted through line 122 to<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> second signal processor 124, which is a suitable conventional electronic signal processing circuit which suitably processes and conditions the electrical signal representations of pressure and transmits these signals to a suitable display means 142, which may be similar to display means 85, via line 144. The processor 124 amplifies the signal for display as shown by tracing 108 in Fig. 9. Signal processor 124 also suitably processes the signal, in accordance with principles commonly known to those of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention pertains, to provide an electronic mean thereof as shown by tracing 110 in Fig. 10. The transducer 118 is referenced to one atmosphere of pressure absolute (101.3 kPa).</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">It should be recognized that ether suitable analog or digital electronic signal processing means can be employed to filter, amplify, compare, and otherwise process the signals. Both pressure transducers 68 and 118 are suitably calibrated against a water manometer prior to use.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">A suitable relief valve 130 is provided in line 60 to protect the system 56 and the patient from over-pressurization. The relief valve 130 is set to open at a suitable pressure of perhaps 5 kPa (50 cm of water pressure) to vent the tubing and balloon to atmosphere in order to prevent dangerously high pressure such as might cause the balloon to rupture.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The absolute balloon pressure wave form 108 is comprised of low amplitude high frequency oscillations effected by left atrial pressure which are superimposed on high amplitude low frequency respiratory oscillations which are in turn superimposed on the gradual increase in balloon pressure provided by gas supply valve 98. The mean balloon pressure wave form is shown at 110 in Fig.<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> 10. By "mean balloon pressure" is meant, for the purposes of this specification and the claims, the balloon pressure at the mean of each of the high frequency (greater than about 0.8 Hertz) oscillations. Stated another way, the "mean balloon pressure" wave form 110 is the absolute balloon pressure wave form 108 with the high frequency oscillations removed therefrom. When a signal is filtered, waves which are removed therefrom do not appear in the output while those which are passed or extracted do appear in the output. The abrupt slope change indicated at 200 from a fast to a slowed rate of pressure increase is indicative of the equalization of balloon pressure with the surrounding tissue pressure prior to balloon expansion.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The differential signal 112 is provided by the signal processor 84 after low frequency oscillations representing the respiratory artifact are filtered out by the differential pressure transducer 68 so that the left atrial pressure wave form is recovered. In addition, the rising absolute pressure due to the gradual inflation of the balloon 24 (which is treated by the filter 72 similarly as a low frequency oscillation and thus passed to transducer side 80) is also cancelled out by the differential transducer 68 so that the pressure signal 112 processed by signal processor 84 is on a steady base line. The signal 112 is then further filtered electronically, amplified, and displayed by the signal processor 84 on display 85.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Wave form 112 may alternatively be obtained by electronically inverting the mean balloon pressure wave form 110 and adding the inverted wave form to the absolute balloon pressure wave form 108 and amplifying the oscillations obtained.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --></p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The use of a bias balloon 150 for alternatively eliminating respiratory artifact to obtain signal 112 is illustrated in Fig. 13. The pressure in balloon 24 is transmitted through lines 60, 62, and 66 to one side 74 of differential pressure transducer 68 similarly as illustrated in Fig. 6. This pressure, which is also transmitted through line 120 to transducer 118 and converted to an electrical signal which is processed and displayed on display 142, includes the effects of respiratory artifact as well as atrial pressure. The bias balloon 150, similar to balloon 24 and similarly inserted by means of a catheter 152, which may be similar to catheter 20, may also be pressurized via line 60 as hereinafter discussed. Bias balloon 150 is inserted into the esophagus intermediate the position of the left atrium and the nasal or mouth passage, i.e., perhaps 3 or 4 cm. or more above the position of balloon 24, so that the pressure therein is not affected by left atrial pressure. But bias balloon 150 does sense respiratory artifact, i.e., pressure swings generated by respiration, and therefore may be said to reflect esophageal pressure and thus record the respiration induced fluctuation in esophageal pressure. The bias balloon pressure is transmitted through lines 154 and 156 to the other side 80 of differential pressure transducer 68. Thus, a pressure effected by absolute left atrial pressure plus respiratory artifact is applied to one side 74 of transducer 68, and a pressure effected by respiratory artifact is applied to the other side 80. The difference, representative of left atrial pressure without the respiratory artifact, is outputted as an electrical signal through line 82 to signal processor 84 which transmits a suitably processed signal of the<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> resulting difference wave through line 87 to signal display 85, which may be similar to display 142. One advantage of bias balloon 150 is that its use will eliminate respiratory artifacts regardless of their frequency. If desired, the bias balloon 150 could also be used to independently measure simultaneous esophageal pressure by transmitting the bias balloon pressure from line 154 via line 158 to transducer 160, which may be similar to transducer 118, which converts the pressure to an electrical signal which is then transmitted via line 162 to signal processor 164, which may be similar to processor 124, in which the signal is suitably processed and transmitted via line 166 to display 168, which may be similar to display 142.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">As shown in Figs. 9 and 10, the low frequency oscillations representative of respiratory artifact decrease in amplitude as the pressure in the balloon 24 increases. In order that the same amplitude of respiratory wave at each point in time may be supplied to both sides of the pressure transducer 68 so that effective cancellation of respiratory artifact may be achieved, balloons 150 and 24 are both connected to gas supply 100 via line 60. Thus, lines 61 and 155 connect line 60 to line 154 for inflation of balloon 150. In order to prevent the cardiac signals from appearing on the bias balloon signal, a suitable low pass filter 157, which may be similar to filter 72, is connected so that line 61 extends from line 60 to input pressure from pressure source 100 to filter 157, and the output of filter 157, with the cardiac waves removed, is transmitted via lines 155 and 154 to balloon 150. In accordance with an alternative (not shown), two separate gas supplies may be provided for balloons 24 and 150 to prevent signal<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> contamination with suitable pressure transducers and electronic feedback means to automatically maintain the mean pressure in the bias balloon 150 equal to the mean pressure in the sensing balloon 24. In accordance with another alternative (not shown), two separate gas supplies may be provided with a pressure regulator on the bias balloon side which is referenced to the mean sensing balloon pressure and such that cardiac oscillations are not conducted across the regulator.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">It should be understood that other means, for example, analog or digital filtering techniques applied directly to the absolute balloon pressure to remove low frequency artifacts such as from respiration or peristalsis may be used for deriving wave form 112 from the absolute balloon pressure, and such other means are meant to come within the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The wave form 112 is thus an oscillating signal of varying amplitude on a steady baseline. These oscillations, derived from absolute balloon pressure, are in response to the driving pressure of the left atrium.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">By noting the peak resonant amplitude of the wave form 112 (Fig. 11) and comparing it to the simultaneous mean balloon pressure 110 (Fig. 10), the mean left atrial pressure can be determined. Thus, in accordance with the oscillometric principle, the mean balloon pressure approximates the mean left atrial pressure when the oscillations of wave form 112 are at a peak, i.e., the peak or highest amplitude oscillations in the wave form 112 occur at the time 116 the balloon pressure is equal to mean left atrial pressure. The mean left atrial pressure is thus determined from the example of Figs. 9 to 12 to be a pressure, illustrated at 128, of about 300 Pa (3 cm water).<!-- EPO <DP n="20"> --></p><p id="p0036" num="0036">It should be recognized that mean left atrial pressure may alternatively be approximated by reference to the absolute balloon pressure wave form 108. Thus, the relatively small amplitude of the high frequency oscillations on wave form 108 would permit one to estimate the mean balloon pressure from which an estimation of mean left atrial pressure may be obtained.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">It should be understood that it is not essential to the present invention that the wave forms in Figs. 9 to 12 be actually obtained in graph or tracing form. For example, an electronic peak detector may alternatively be used to sense the maximum or peak amplitude, and associated electronics may then determine and display the corresponding mean left atrial pressure in accordance with principles commonly known to those of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention pertains.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The relaxed diameter of the normal adult esophagus is about 2.5 cm. The inflated balloon diameter should be less than this in order to avoid stretching the esophagus since, if this were to happen, not all of the balloon pressure would be applied to the left atrial wall with the result that the balloon pressure at peak oscillation would be higher than the mean left atrial pressure. In addition, if the balloon is too large, its inflation may trigger secondary peristalsis. On the other hand, if the inflated balloon diameter is too small, it will not be able to exert adequate pressure against the left atrium during inflation, nor will it have optimal contact area to optimize pulse transmission. The balloon length should be adequate to provide optimal longitudinal contact with the left atrium and pulmonary veins in which the mean<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> pressure equals mean left atrial pressure, but should not extend too far beyond the left atrium where it could pick up pressure artifacts from the aorta or lower esophageal sphincter. In accordance with the above requirements, for use in adults, the balloon 24 preferably has an inflated diameter, illustrated at 132 in Fig. 2, which is between about 0.9 and 1.5 cm and an inflated length, illustrated at 134 in Fig. 1, which is between about 3.0 and 4.0 cm. More preferably, the balloon 24 has an inflated diameter 132 of about 1 cm and an inflated length 134 of about 3.5 cm providing a volume of about 2 milliliters. This diameter still allows the vertebral column to serve as an anvil since the esophagus is normally collapsed. For children and neonates the above sizes will be suitably reduced.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Maximum oscillation of balloon pressure may coincidently occur just before the balloon reaches its full volume after which the balloon pressure may rise very sharply, as indicated at 196 in Fig. 10. Sometimes this sharp rise may obscure the point of maximum balloon oscillation. In order to allow better control of balloon pressure filling for smoother balloon inflation near the point of maximum oscillation, in accordance with a preferred embodiment, illustrated in Figs. 14 and 15, a balloon with an exhaust line for exhausting the balloon outside the body is used to slow such a rapid pressure rise. In this embodiment, a pair of catheters 170 and 172 containing lumens 171 and 173 respectively are attached to esophageal balloon 174. Catheter 170 is attached to line 60. Though not shown in Fig. 14 for ease of illustration, the equipment attached to line 60 in Fig. 6 should also be understood to be attached to line 60 in Fig. 14. Catheter 172 is connected via line 176 to a four-way<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> --> stopcock 178 or other suitable valve and subsequently via line 180 to a Nupro controlled exhaust valve 182 which exhausts through line 184 to atmosphere. Exhaust valve 182 may be of any suitable type such as, for example, one which is similar to control valve 98.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">As discussed previously with respect to the embodiment of Fig. 6, when an exhaust valve is not used the control valve 98 is set at a constant flow rate and then left alone to gradually fill the balloon. However, with the stopcock 178 open to connect the exhaust valve 182 to the balloon 174, the exhaust valve 182 is set to a position which is determined by experience, and which can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention pertains without undue experimentation, and control valve 98 is used for balloon pressure control. The balloon 174 is pressurized by steadily opening the control valve 98 and using the exhaust valve 182, which is set at the fixed setting and left alone, to provide back pressure. The control valve 98 is thus continuously opened to increase the flow through the balloon 174 with the pressure gradually rising. At some point, in accordance with the oscillometric principle the balloon oscillates maximally, as effected by left atrial pressure, after which the oscillations decrease as the balloon pressure increases further. The exhaust valve 182 is provided to achieve finer supply gas control so that the peak of oscillations may be more precisely determined. Thus, as the pressure in the balloon 174 increases, it is believed that the flow through the exhaust valve 182 increases, thus slowing and stabilizing the pressure rise, without affecting the relative amplitudes of oscillations effected by left atrial pressure<!-- EPO <DP n="23"> --> whereby the peak in such oscillations may still occur at the same balloon pressure value from which mean left atrial pressure can be determined. An esophageal electrode wire 186 for an electrode 188, which may be similar to electrode 21, is routed through the exhaust line catheter 172 to thereby alleviate the need for a separate catheter for the wire 186. As seen in Fig. 15, the catheter 172 suitably extends into the interior of balloon 174 and has an open end 190 for receiving exhaust. By closing the stopcock 178, the embodiment of Fig. 14 can, if desired, be reverted for use without the exhaust line, similarly as discussed with respect to the embodiment of Fig. 6.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">If desired, lumens 171 and 173 may be provided within a single catheter. In accordance with another alternative embodiment, a single lumen catheter may be provided with a side port which has a vent valve that could provide some back pressure during filling but which would attentuate the abrupt pressure rise when the balloon reaches its maximum volume. Yet another means for attenuating this abrupt pressure rise may be to throttle the flow-control valve as maximum balloon volume is reached so that filling toward the end stages is slowed.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">In certain body positions such as supine and semi-recumbent, the heart weight bears on the esophagus. In other body positions such as standing, sitting, lying on the side, or prone, the heart weight would not bear on the esophagus. It is presently believed that the pressure effect of heart weight per se against the esophagus has little if any effect on the peak balloon oscillation pressure irregardless of the body position of the patient. However, in order to insure a measurement of peak<!-- EPO <DP n="24"> --> balloon oscillation pressure uninfluenced by heart weight, it is preferred that the determination of mean left atrial pressure, as hereinbefore described, be made while the patient is positioned standing, sitting, lying on the side, prone, or in any other position wherein the heart weight does not bear on the esophagus.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">A physiologically and medically important pressure, the mean left atrial transmural pressure, can also be determined with information available from the catheter. This pressure is the difference between the mean left atrial pressure and the pleural pressure (the pressure of the tissue immediately surrounding the heart). It is important to know this transmural pressure because it can influence the degree to which fluid will leave the pulmonary capillaries and enter the lung tissue, causing pulmonary edema or "wet lungs".</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The pleural pressure can be determined by measuring the mean esophageal pressure in the esophagus at a location above and away from the heart, i.e., at least about 3 or 4 cm above the heart, such as to be unaffected by pressure in the heart, using principles commonly known to those of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention pertains.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The mean esophageal pressure can be determined by moving the sensing balloon away from under the heart after peak oscillation measurement or by the use of a second balloon-tipped catheter. For example, bias balloon 150 of Fig. 13 may be used to obtain esophageal pressure, uninfluenced by heart weight, which is determined by measuring the balloon pressure at a slope change, which may be similar to slope change 200, from a fast to a slowed rate of pressure increase indicative of equalization of<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> balloon pressure with the surrounding tissue pressure, i.e., mean esophageal pressure, prior to balloon expansion. Alternatively, the mean esophageal pressure may be determined by evacuating balloon 150, then adding a small volume of gas (slightly greater than the dead space volume of the catheter and connecting tubing), and taking the mean of the resulting esophageal pressure wave form.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The apparatus of the present invention may be used for providing precise determination of mean left atrial pressure for patients connected to respirators. However, when a patient is connected to a breathing machine which uses positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), the patient's pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and mean left atrial pressure (MLAP) may be elevated as a result, since all intra-thoracic structures are exposed to varying degrees to this pressure. Since mean esophageal pressure reflects intra-pleural pressure (a good measure of the pressure environment in the chest), the mean esophageal pressure will provide a measure of the effect of PEEP on thoracic structures. Thus, the mean left atrial transmural pressure, as provided by the catheter, provides an excellent means to understand the physiologic and clinical impact of PEEP on the heart and lungs since it takes into account simultaneous pressure changes induced in both the left atrium and the esophagus by the imposition of PEEP.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Using the apparatus of the present invention, as illustrated in Fig. 6 and using a surface electrocardiogram for positioning the balloon 24, average mean left atrial pressure measurements were obtained for two healthy adults with the catheter in these persons sitting upright dry or immersed to the neck in thermoneutral water.

In particular, the present invention relates to the pretreatment of a test sample to permit the analytical determination of a tricyclic antidepressant drug which does not contain a sulfur moiety in the presence of one or more interfering substances.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>Background of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">The determination of analytes has become very useful in a variety of fields such as biochemical research, environmental and industrial testing, and especially medical diagnostics. The monitoring of therapeutic drug levels and other analytes in biological fluids such as serum, plasma, whole blood, urine, and the like, has become very useful to provide physicians with information to aid in patient management. The monitoring of such drug levels enables adjustment of patient dosage to achieve optimal therapeutic effects, and helps avoid either subtherapeutic or toxic levels.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A test sample may contain one or more detectable compounds having chemical structures which are substantially similar to, or which resemble, or which could resemble, and therefore be indistinguishable from, the desired analyte of interest. For example, in the area of medical diagnostics where it is important to monitor the level of therapeutic drugs, a number of drugs having substantially similar chemical structures may be administered to a patient wherein a test sample from such patient could contain detectable levels thereof.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In such instances, the analytical determination of the desired analyte may be interfered with by the presence of such one or more additional substances having substantially similar chemical structures to the chemical structure of the analyte of interest to thereby produce inconsistent and inaccurate results. In particular, where the analytical determination involves immunoassay techniques employing antibodies capable of binding to the analyte of interest, such antibodies may also bind or crossreact with such other substances having substantially similar chemical structures. Similarly, where the analytical determination involves high pressure liquid chromatography techniques or thin layer chromatography techniques, the elution profile of the analyte of interest may be indistinguishable from the elution profile of such other substances having substantially similar chemical structures.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">U.S. Patent No. 4,810,635 discloses a fluorescence energy transfer immunoassay for the detection of digoxin in a serum sample in which interfering endogenous fluorescence has been eliminated by treatment of the sample with a strong oxidizing agent. U.S. Patent No. 4,668,620 discloses an enzyme-label immunoassay in which a serum sample has been treated with a peracid compound to reduce or eliminate background interference contributed by serum components. U.S. Patent No. 4,829,012 discloses an immunoassay for IgM antibodies in a liquid sample, such as a biological fluid, in which interfering IgG antibodies are modified by the binding of the IgG antibodies to anti-IgG antibodies. Alltech Associates, Inc. Chromatography Catalog #150, issued 1988, pages 58 and 258-263 discloses various chromatography assays for different analyte families involving the pre-treatment with a derivatization agent which allows the differential analysis of a predetermined member(s) of a selected substance family in the presence of other member(s) of the same family. Chemical Abstracts, vol. 106, no. 17, issued 27 April 1987, (Y.H. Cho et al., Arch. Pharmacal. Res. 1986, 9(3), 131-8) discloses the determination of barbiturates such as thiopental in plasma by gas chromatography-flame photometric detector after N,N'-dimethylthiomethyl derivatization. Chemical Abstracts, vol. 98, no. 7, issued 14 February 1983 (K.E. Karlsson, J. Chromatography 1981, 219(3), 373-8) discloses differential analysis of secondary and tertiary amine amitryptiline (a parent compound and its structurally similar metabolites) by gas chromatography following a two-phase derivatization to carbamates. Biological Abstracts, vol. 68, no. 9, issued 01 November 1979 (H.F. Proelss et al., Clin. Chem. 24(11):1948-1953, 1978) discloses a high-performance liquid chromatographic simultaneous determination of five commonly used tricyclic antidepressants (doxepin, desipramine, nortriptyline, imipramine and amitriptyline) in serum in which interference from drugs such as phenothiazines occurs. Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc.

As would be understood by one skilled in the art, phenothiazines are often co-prescribed to a patient being treated with a tricyclic antidepressant drug wherein a test sample from such patient would therefore contain levels of both drugs. According to such preferred embodiment, such test sample is contacted with an oxidative reagent, preferably chloramine-T (sodium salt of N-chloro-4-methylbenzene sulfonamide) or chloramine-B (sodium salt of N-chlorobenzene sulfonamide), to selectively modify the chemical structure of the phenothiazines whereby the phenothiazines present in the test sample are selectively oxidized to their corresponding sulfoxides or sulfones.

It is to be understood that the analyte of interest and such interfering substances could be substantially dissimilar but, at the same time, could have conformational aspects in which they resemble each other.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In particular, analytes of interest include, but are not intended to be limited to, tricyclic antidepressant drugs such as amitriptyline, nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, protriptyline, doxepin, clomipramine and desdoxepin; and benzodiazepines such as diazepam.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In particular, interfering substances include, but are not intended to be limited to phenothiazines such as chloropromazine, desmethylchloropromazine, thioridazine, desmethylthioridazine, sulforidazine and mesoridazine, and thioxanthines such as thiothixene.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to the present invention, the pretreatment reagent is specific for and is capable of selectively modifying the chemical structure at one or more sites or positions of one or more interfering substances present in a test sample.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">It is to be appreciated that once the chemical structure of the interfering substance has been modified according to the present invention, the analytical determination of the analyte can be made. Also according to the present invention, the pretreatment reagent can be selected from a variety of oxidative reagents capable of substantially modifying the chemical structure of the interfering substance. Such reagents include, but are not intended to be limited to N-chlorosulfonamides such as chloramine-T and chloramine-B; hypochlorites such as sodium hypochlorite and hypochlorous acid; hypobromites such as sodium hypobromite and hypobromous acid; peroxides such as sodium hydroperoxide; peracids such as perselenic acid and 3-chloroperbenzoic acid; and oxidative enzymes such as catalase, peroxidase and microperoxidase. For sulfur-containing interfering substances, such as phenothiazines, the pretreatment reagent is preferably selected from the group<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> consisting of sodium hypochlorite, catalase, and perselenic acid, more preferably chloramine-T.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">As would be understood by one skilled in the art apprised of the foregoing considerations and as will be described in greater detail in the specific embodiments and examples hereinbelow, selection of a particular pretreatment reagent will depend upon the chemical structure of the analyte of interest and the chemical structure of interfering substances which may be present in a test sample. It is to be understood that in addition to being added or introduced into a test sample from an external source, the oxidative reagent can alternatively be generated or otherwise formed <u>in</u> <u>situ</u>, such as the generation of hydrogen peroxide. For example, in the case of an analytical system containing the analyte of interest, an interfering substance as described herein, selenium dioxide, and glucose oxidase, to which glucose is added, hydrogen peroxide is formed <u>in</u> <u>situ</u>. This is particularly useful for the packaging of reagents in that the packaging and shipment of strong oxidizing agents can be avoided by providing reagents which can form, <u>in</u> <u>situ</u>, the oxidative reagent for use as described herein. In addition, the pretreatment reagent can be presented as a liquid reagent, a dry reagent, or immobilized to a solid support material according to methods known in the art.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Although the pretreatment reagent can be employed in the analytical systems as described above, the pretreatment reagent according to the present invention is especially useful in a fluorescent polarization immunoassay (FPIA) system. For example, in a competitive protein binding or immunoassay, a substance being measured, often referred to as a ligand, competes with a substance of close structural similarity coupled to a detectable moiety, often referred to as a tracer, for a limited number of binding sites on antibodies specific to the portion or portions of the ligand and tracer with structural similarity, shared with an immunogen employed to produce such antibodies. In a fluorescent polarization immunoassay, the detectable moiety component of the tracer is a fluorescent moiety selected from the group consisting of fluoresceins, aminofluoresceins, carboxyfluoresceins, fluoresceinamines, and the like.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to such FPIA format, the amount of tracer bound to the antibody varies inversely to the amount of ligand present in either the test sample or standard calibrator solution in a predictable manner. The relative, and therefore characteristic, binding affinities of the ligand and the tracer to the antibody binding site, are important parameters of the assay system. In particular, FPIA techniques are based on the principle that a fluorescent tracer, when excited by plane polarized light of<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> a characteristic wavelength, will emit light at another characteristic wavelength (i.e., fluorescence) that retains a degree of the polarization relative to the incident stimulating light that is inversely related to the rate of rotation of the tracer in a given medium. As a consequence of this property, a tracer substance with constrained rotation, such as in a viscous solution phase or when bound to another solution component with a relatively lower rate of rotation, will retain a relatively greater degree of polarization of emitted light than if in free solution. Therefore, within the time frame in which the ligand and tracer compete for binding to the antibody, the tracer and ligand binding rates should yield an appropriate proportion of free and bound tracer with the preservation of important performance parameters such as selectivity, sensitivity, and precision.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">For example, for the FPIA determination of imipramine, a test sample is contacted with the pretreatment reagent according to the present invention and with imipramine antiserum in the presence of an appropriately selected fluorescein derivative thereof which is capable of producing a detectable fluorescence polarization response to the presence of imipramine antiserum. Plane polarized light is then passed through the solution to obtain a fluorescent polarization response and the response is detected as a measure of the amount of imipramine present in the test<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> sample when compared to the response of standard calibrators prepared from the native compound.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">As described herein, the test sample containing the analyte of interest and such other interfering substances is a biological test sample such as whole blood, serum, plasma, urine, feces, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">According to the present invention, there is provided a test kit useful for the fluorescent polarization immunoassay determination of a tricyclic antidepressant drug present in a test sample, wherein said antidepressant drug does not contain a sulfur moiety and wherein said test sample includes a sulfur-containing compound having a chemical structure which is similar to said tricyclic antidepressant drug and is immunologically crossreactive with an antibody to said antidepressant drug, said test kit comprising (a) an oxidative reagent, or reagents which can generate hydrogen peroxide as an oxidative reagent in the test sample, said oxidative reagent being capable of modifying the chemical structure of said sulfur-containing compound by selectively oxidizing the sulfur moiety of said sulfur-containing compound without modifying the chemical structure of said tricyclic antidepressant drug, whereby crossreactive binding of said antibody to said tricyclic antidepressant drug to said modified sulfur-containing compound is reduced and (b) all essential additional reagents for performing the fluorescent polarization immunoassay determination including an antibody to said tricyclic antidepressant drug and a suitable fluorescent tracer compound.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to the present invention, there is also provided a test kit useful for the chromatographic determination of a tricyclic antidepressant drug present in a test sample, wherein said antidepressant drug does not contain a sulfur moiety and wherein said test sample includes a sulfur-containing compound having a chemical structure which is similar to said tricyclic antidepressant drug and an elution profile which interferes with the elution profile of said tricyclic antidepressant drug, said test kit comprising (a) an oxidative reagent, or reagents which can generate hydrogen peroxide as an oxidative reagent in the test sample, said oxidative reagent being capable of modifying the chemical structure of said sulfur-containing compound by selectively oxidizing the sulfur moiety of said sulfur-containing compound without modifying the chemical structure of said tricyclic antidepressant drug, whereby the elution profile of said modified sulfur-containing compound does not interfere with the elution profile of said tricyclic antidepressant drug; and (b) all essential additional reagents for performing the chromatographic determination including an internal standard.

In particular, antibodies directed to IMI may recognize<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> chlorpromazine or desmethylchlorpromazine as well as imipramine when present in a patient sample. In order to prevent the error in quantitation that would result, the sample is treated with chloramine-T to oxidatively modify the structure of the chlorpromazine or desmethylchlorpromazine to a form much less well recognized by this antitricyclic immune serum.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">For the determination of imipramine, the sample (0.100 mL) was rendered basic by the addition of 0.100 mL of 0.25 M NaOH and dissociated from serum proteins by the addition of 0.025 mL of isoamyl alcohol. The mixture was allowed to stand for up to 5.0 minutes, after which time 0.50 mL of decane was added and the sample vortexed vigorously for 1.0 minute. The sample/decane biphasic mixture was then centrifuged for up to 5.0 minutes to clarify those phases. In the case of imipramine, 0.100 mL of the decane upper phase was transferred to a tube containing 0.100 mL of acidic buffer, pH 3, to which 0.010 mL of 20 microgram per mL of chloramine-T had been added. This amount of chloramine-T can completely modify up to 1.0 microgram of chlorpromazine in the original sample. Variations in the quantity of chloramine-T may be made to accommodate differing ranges of phenothiazine concentrations expected to be present in the sample. Table I below illustrates a typical example of results obtained from comparing the analysis of a sample containing, as in this case, 300 ng/mL<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> of chlorpromazine and 128 ng/mL of imipramine, employing an Abbott TDx analytical system. Chlorpromazine crossreacts with the antibody used in the FPIA for imipramine. This quantity of chlorpromazine yielded a significant overestimate of the amount of imipramine actually present in the sample (171%). Treatment of the sample extract with chloramine-T modifies the structure of the chlorpromazine in such a fashion that it is no longer an assay interferant. Inclusion of the chloramine-T treatment removed this overestimate entirely. <tables id="tabl0001" num="0001"><table frame="all"><title>TABLE I</title><tgroup cols="3" colsep="1" rowsep="0"><colspec colnum="1" colname="col1" colwidth="52.50mm"/><colspec colnum="2" colname="col2" colwidth="52.50mm"/><colspec colnum="3" colname="col3" colwidth="52.50mm"/><thead valign="top"><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col3" align="center">Removal Of Chlorpromazine Interferant In FPIA For Imipramine</entry></row><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">Sample</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left">Treatment</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="left">Mass</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">IMI</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left">NONE</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">128 ng/mL</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">IMI+300 ng CPZ</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left">NONE</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">219 ng/mL</entry></row><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">IMI+300 ng CPZ</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left">Chloramine-T</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">130 ng/mL</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The procedure described above could also be followed for the analysis of desipramine in the presence of phenothiazines to achieve the elimination of interfering substances as described herein.<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --></p><heading id="h0008"><u>EXAMPLE 2</u></heading><heading id="h0009">High Pressure Liquid Chromatography Determination of Imipramine and Desipramine</heading><p id="p0027" num="0027">In the HPLC analysis of tricyclic antidepressants such as imipramine and desipramine, phenothiazines such as chlorpromazine or its metabolite, desmethylchlorpromazine, may interfere with the analysis of the tricyclic antidepressants or one of their metabolites.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">A 1.0 mL sample to which an internal standard substance was added was rendered basic by the addition of 0.200 mL of 1.0 M NaOH followed by the addition of 0.200 mL of isoamyl alcohol to inhibit analyte/protein interaction.

The solid- and mobile-phase constituents for this HPLC analytical procedure were as described in Example 2 above.</p><heading id="h0016"><u>EXAMPLE 6</u></heading><heading id="h0017">Removal of Chlorpromazine Interferant By Selenium Dioxide In The Presence of Hydrogen Peroxide</heading><p id="p0037" num="0037">A test sample (0.100 mL) containing imipramine was rendered basic by the addition of 0.100 mL of 0.25 M NaOH and dissociated from serum proteins by the addition of 0.025 mL of isoamyl alcohol. The mixture was allowed to stand for up to 5.0 minutes, after which time 0.50 mL of nonane was added and the sample vortexed vigorously for 1.0 minute.<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> The mixture was then centrifuged for up to 5.0 minutes at approximately 2000 x g to clarify the phases. A 0.100 mL aliquot of the nonane upper phase was then transferred to a tube containing 0.100 mL of an acidic buffer containing 100 ug/mL of selenium dioxide (SeO<sub>2</sub>). To this biphasic mixture, 20 uL of a 30% aqueous solution of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was added and the mixture was vortexed, ninety microliters (0.090 mL) of the lower aqueous phase was then transferred to the sample wells and analyzed by the Abbott TDx analytical system (Table IV). Treatment of the sample extract with selenium dioxide and hydrogen peroxide modified the chemical structure of chlorpromazine such that it was no longer an assay interferant whereas selenium dioxide in the absence of hydrogen peroxide did not cause the conversion of chlorpromazine to chlorpromazine sulfoxide or sulfone. <tables id="tabl0004" num="0004"><table frame="all"><title>TABLE IV</title><tgroup cols="3" colsep="1" rowsep="0"><colspec colnum="1" colname="col1" colwidth="52.50mm"/><colspec colnum="2" colname="col2" colwidth="52.50mm"/><colspec colnum="3" colname="col3" colwidth="52.50mm"/><thead valign="top"><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col3" align="center">Removal Of Chlorpromazine Interferant In FPIA For Imipramine</entry></row><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">Sample</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left">Treatment</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="center">Mass Measured</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">IMI</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left">NONE</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="char" char=".">15 ng/mL</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">IMI+312 ng CPZ</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left">NONE</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="char" char=".">98 ng/mL</entry></row><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">IMI+312 ng CPZ</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left">SeO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub></entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="char" char=".">14.7 ng/mL</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p>

Binding of gallium to transferrins, particularly lactoferrin, is thought to be responsible for some of the transport of gallium in the body, and for the concentration of gallium in certain tumors and inflamed tissues. Radioactive <sup>67</sup>Ga citrate compositions are used in patients to diagnose certain malignancies and infections, including those in bone tissue. Non-radioactive gallium compositions, and compositions containing other Group IIIa elements, have been found effective in treating some tumors in animals and humans. Gallium is thought to be the most effective of these Group IIIa elements<sup>1,3,4</sup>. The art recognizes that gallium is useful for the treatment and prevention of many human and other mammalian diseases, including hypercalcemia, cancer, and certain degenerative or metabolic bone diseases such as osteoporosis and Paget's disease<sup>2-6,13</sup>. Gallium itself appears to be the active agent; the form in which the gallium is administered (e.g. as the nitrate, sulfate, or chloride) does not appear to affect its activity to any significant extent<sup>3,6</sup>.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Gallium is particularly useful in the treatment and prevention of hypercalcemia and certain bone diseases. Treatable bone diseases include such widespread conditions as osteoporosis, osteopenia, Paget's disease, malignant bone disease, bone degeneration due to hyperparathyroidism, and other conditions associated with increased bone resorption or turnover in humans or animals<sup>4,6</sup>. In addition to the above, it has been found that gallium increases calcium accretion in bone and decreases bone resorption<sup>5</sup>.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Specifically, Warrell et al.<sup>4,6</sup> and Bockman et al.<sup>5</sup> disclose treatments using gallium salts, preferably gallium nitrate, for regulating the resorption of calcium from bone in certain bane diseases and hypercalcemia, and for increasing the mass and tensile strength of bone. Warrell et al.<sup>4</sup> discloses that such regulation entails the generation of plasma gallium concentrations in the patient of from about 0.9 to 2.0 µg/ml whereas Bockman et al.<sup>5</sup> recite the generation of plasma gallium concentrations in the patient of from about 0.1 to 5.0 µg/ml.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Treatment of cancer with gallium nitrate is disclosed by Foster et al.<sup>13</sup> which teaches the administration (by infusion) of gallium nitrate at 700-750 mg/m<sup>2</sup> by short infusion every 2-3 weeks; 300 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day by short infusion for three consecutive days, to be repeated every 2 weeks; and 300 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day by continuous infusion for 7 consecutive days, to be repeated every 3-5 weeks. Specific cancers treated in this reference include, by way of example, refractory lymphomas, small cell lung carcinoma, genitourinary malignancies (renal, bladder, prostate, testicular), and multiple myeloma.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">On the other hand, Collery<sup>2</sup> discloses the treatment of cancer by the oral administration of a dose of from 200 mg to 1 gram of gallium chloride per day for at least 2 months.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">However, in spite of its established utility, the use of gallium in the treatment of such diseases is hampered by the fact that ionic gallium lacks high bioavailability when delivered orally. In fact, ionic gallium is a form of gallium which is poorly absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. In this regard, Warrell et al.<sup>4</sup> disclose that when a composition of gallium nitrate is administered orally to a dog, only 0.5 to 2% of the gallium is absorbed from the gastrointestinal<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> tract, into the bloodstream and then excreted into the urine. The percent absorption of other Ga<sup>+3</sup> salts is not likely to be significantly different, as such salts dissociate in aqueous solutions to produce mainly trivalent gallium ions in a similar manner to gallium nitrate.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The low bioavailability of orally delivered gallium salts (i.e., ionic gallium) and the need to generate blood plasma gallium concentrations in the patient of from 0.1 to 5 µg/ml of plasma gallium concentration (and preferably 0.5 to 2 µg/ml) for the treatment of hypercalcemia or excessive bone resorption<sup>5</sup> requires that either impractically large doses of orally delivered gallium be administered to the patient or that the gallium be administered via non-oral means (e.g., intravenous delivery). The oral delivery of such gallium salts is not believed to be practical particularly with widespread, chronic conditions such as osteoporosis and the like.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention is directed to the discovery that gallium bioavailability via oral administration is greatly enhanced by using electrostatically neutral gallium chelates of certain 3-hydroxy-4-pyrones. The present invention is directed to the further discoveries that because such neutral gallium chelates decompose in the acidic conditions commonly present in the stomach, pharmaceutical compositions of orally delivered neutral gallium chelates must contain means to inhibit dissociation of the neutral gallium chelates under such acidic conditions.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In regard to the above, it is noted that Finnegan et al.<sup>15</sup> disclose the preparation of aluminum and gallium complexes of some 3-hydroxy-4-pyrones, including maltol. This reference recites that the aluminum maltol complex is highly neurotoxic when injected intracranially into rabbits, and suggests<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> further neurotoxicity experiments with the aluminum and gallium complexes. This reference further recites nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) experiments that demonstrated significant differences between the aqueous behavior of the complexes of aluminum and gallium, i.e., experiments to determine the stability of gallium complexes as a function of pH could not be performed, whereas such experiments were readily performed on aluminum complexes.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Further regarding the significant differences between aluminum and gallium, aluminum is well known in the art to be a cause of degenerative bone disease<sup>17</sup> as well as being neurotoxic. Contrarily and as previously discussed, gallium is known in the art as effective in the treatment of degenerative bone disease and has shown no reported evidence of neurotoxicity.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Farrar et al.<sup>16</sup> disclose the preparation of an aqueous solution containing 10 mM maltol, 1 mM Ga(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, and a trace of GaCl<sub>3</sub> labelled with radioactive <sup>67</sup>Ga for administration to rats by oral gavage. However, it is not established in this reference that this solution contains a significant amount of the neutral 3:1 complex. In any event, Farrar et al. completely fail to even consider the possibility that pH might affect the stability of a Ga-maltol complex. This reference also completely fails to realize, suggest, or imply any method to increase gallium absorption in fed animals. Additionally, this reference fails to suggest combining such gallium complexes with means to inhibit dissociation of the complex in a mammalian stomach.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Lastly, Hider et al.<sup>14</sup> disclose orally deliverable pharmaceutical compositions containing neutral iron complexes of 3-hydroxy-4-pyrones and means to inhibit dissociation of such complexes under acidic conditions. However, the teachings of this reference are expressly limited to iron and it is art recognized that gallium<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> is not equivalent to iron. Further in this regard, iron is a Group VIII metal that is easily oxidized and reduced between its +2 and +3 valences at physiologic conditions, whereas gallium is a Group IIIa semi-metal be that exists only with a +3 valence state at physiologic conditions.</p><heading id="h0005"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">In view of the above, the present invention is directed to methods for increasing the bioavailability of gallium into the bloodstream as well as to pharmaceutical compositions employed to achieve such methods.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Particularly, a primary object of the present invention is to provide the pharmaceutical composition defined in the appended claims.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In one of its aspects the present invention is directed to a composition for administering gallium to a mammalian patient (e.g., human patient) which comprises the oral ingestion of a sufficient amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>(a) a neutral 3:1 gallium complex of a 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone wherein said 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone has the formula<chemistry id="chem0001" num="0001"><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="51" he="35" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry> wherein each R is independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and alkyl of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms; and</li><li>(b) means to inhibit dissociation of said complex under acidic conditions of the gastro portion of said gastrointestinal tract<br/>so as to provide a blood plasma gallium concentration of from about 0.1 to about 5 µg/ml.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition for increasing calcium accretion in bone or for decreasing calcium resorption in a mammal (e.g., a human) comprising<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>(a) a neutral 3:1 gallium complex of a 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone wherein said 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone has the formula<chemistry id="chem0002" num="0002"><img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="52" he="34" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry> wherein each R is independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, and alkyl of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms; and</li><li>(b) means to inhibit dissociation of said complex under acidic conditions of the gastro portion of the gastrointestinal tract.</li></ul></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Such a composition can be in a solid dosage form for oral administration.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The compositions of this invention are useful for orally delivering gallium to humans and other mammals for a wide variety of medical and veterinary applications, including, by way of example, the treatment of bone diseases relating to the increased resorption of calcium into the bloodstream.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><heading id="h0006"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0021" num="0021">As noted above, the present invention is directed to methods and compositions for enhancing the bioavailability of gallium from orally delivered pharmaceutical compositions containing gallium. However, prior to discussing this invention in further detail, the following terms will first be defined. Unless defined below, the terms used herein have their normally accepted meanings.</p><heading id="h0007">1. <u>Definitions</u></heading><p id="p0022" num="0022">As used herein, the following terms have the definitions given below:</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The term "neutral 3:1 gallium complex of a 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone" refers to an electrostatically neutral complex of Ga<sup>+3</sup> and 3 equivalents of the anionic form of 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone which complex is represented by the formula [Ga<sup>+3</sup>(py<sup>-1</sup>)<sub>3</sub>] wherein py<sup>-1</sup> represents the anionic form of 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone which is defined below. Because such complexes do not dissociate to any significant extent in aqueous solutions maintained at a pH of from about 5 to about 9, these complexes remain predominantly electrostatically neutral in such solutions.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In this regard, these complexes are deemed "electrostatically neutral" because there are equal numbers of positive and negative charges in the complex.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Also, it is apparent that the anionic form of the 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone acts as a chelating agent to the gallium and as such, the complex is sometimes referred to herein as "neutral gallium chelates of 3-hydroxy-4-pyrones". It being understood that this latter term is<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> synonymous with the term "neutral 3:1 gallium complex of a 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone".</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The term "a 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone" refers to a compound of the Formula 1:<chemistry id="chem0003" num="0003"><img id="ib0003" file="imgb0003.tif" wi="83" he="33" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry> wherein each R is independently selected from hydrogen atoms and alkyl of from one to six carbon atoms.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Specific compounds encompassed by the term "a 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone" are represented by the Formulas 2-5 below:<chemistry id="chem0004" num="0004"><img id="ib0004" file="imgb0004.tif" wi="144" he="69" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry> where in each R' is independently alkyl of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The unsubstituted form of 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone (Formula 2, also called pyromeconic acid) contains three hydrogen atoms that are bound only to ring carbon atoms.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> The locations of a few possible substitutions are presented in Formulas 3-5, in which R' is an alkyl group (including methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, and n-propyl). The groups are preferably acyclic and are preferably unbranched. Groups containing six or fewer carbon atoms, particularly of one through three carbon atoms, especially methyl or ethyl, are preferred. Single substitution is preferred; a substitution at either the 6-position or especially the 2-position is preferred. Some examples of specific compounds whose gallium complexes may be used in compositions comprised by the invention are: 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4-pyrone (Formula 3, R' = CH<sub>3</sub> -- sometimes referred to as maltol or larixinic acid) and 3-hydroxy-2-ethyl-4-pyrone (Formula 3, R' = C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub> -- sometimes referred to as ethyl maltol or ethylpyromeconic acid), both of which are preferred for use in this invention, especially 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4-pyrone. Other preferred compounds include 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone (Formula 2 -- sometimes referred to as pyromeconic acid); and 3-hydroxy-6-methyl-4-pyrone (Formula 4, R' = CH<sub>3</sub>).</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The term "an anion of a 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone" refers to a compound defined in Formulas 2-5 above wherein the hydroxyl proton has been removed so as to provide for the anionically charged form of these compounds.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The terms "oral administration" and "oral ingestion" refer to all conventional forms for the oral delivery of a pharmaceutical composition to a patient (e.g., human) and that result in the deposition of the pharmaceutical composition into the gastrointestinal tract (including the gastro portion of the gastrointestinal tract, i.e., the stomach) of the patient. Accordingly, oral administration and oral<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> ingestion include, by way of example, actual ingestion of a solid or liquid pharmaceutical composition, oral gavage, and the like.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The term "inhibit dissociation" means that at least 20%, preferably at least 50% and more preferably at least 80%, of the complex is not dissociated under acidic conditions (e.g., about pH 2-4) for a period of at least 1 hr and preferably at least 3 hours.</p><heading id="h0008">2. <u>Synthesis and Methodology</u></heading><p id="p0032" num="0032">This invention includes methods for the preparation of neutral 3:1 gallium complexes of 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone or 3-hydroxy-4-pyrones of formula 1. Such methods comprise reacting such hydroxypyrones with gallium ions and isolating, at least in part, the resulting complex or complexes.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Specifically, the neutral 3:1 gallium complex of a 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone is prepared by the reaction of gallium ions and the 3-hydroxy-4-pyrones in solution. Gallium ions can be derived from a gallium salt, such as a gallium halide, particularly gallium chloride, or a gallium nitrate compound, especially a hydrated gallium nitrate. The gallium nitrate compounds are often preferable as they are easier to work with than gallium halides, which may be highly irritating and may react violently with many solvents, including water. Using the proper safeguards, a variety of gallium salts can be used. The reaction is conveniently effected in a mutual solvent, including but not limited to mixtures containing water, ethanol, methanol, and, chloroform. Pure water may be used in many cases, though the purification of the gallium hydroxypyrone complexes may<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> be difficult if it is used. A preferable method, if it is desired to separate at least a major part of reaction by-products such as sodium nitrates, sodium chloride, and sodium carbonates, is to use a mixture containing roughly equal parts of ethanol and chloroform, with a trace of water. The reaction by-products mentioned above have very low solubilities in this mixture and can be removed readily by filtration.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">To produce the preferred neutral 3:1 hydroxypyrone:gallium complex, the hydroxypyrone and the gallium ions are mixed in 3:1 molar proportions, preferably with a slight excess of hydroxypyrone to insure a great preponderance of the 3:1 complex over the 2:1 and 1:1 complexes. The proportions of the particular complexes formed are dependent upon the pH of the solution. When a gallium salt such as a halide or nitrate is dissolved, the resulting solution will generally have a low pH. To form a preponderance of the preferred neutral 3:1 complex, a pH of from 5 to 9, preferably 7 through 8, is used. If a more acidic solution is used, a preponderance of the less preferred 2:1 and 1:1 complexes may instead be formed, even if a large excess of hydroxypyrone is present. Under highly basic conditions, poorly soluble gallium hydroxides may precipitate. It is preferable to regulate the pH with materials other than hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide, as the use of such hydroxides may cause the precipitation of poorly soluble gallium hydroxides, which are not wanted, and the pH may actually be buffered at a low level by this precipitation. The use of a carbonate, especially sodium carbonate, is preferred to regulate the pH. The use of sodium carbonate in a solvent mixture containing ethanol and chloroform, for example, can result in the precipitation of sodium nitrates that are very slightly soluble in this mixture, and which can be filtered off<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> if desired to help purify the solution containing the desired pharmaceutical compositions.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The reaction to form the hydroxypyrone-gallium complex in solution is generally complete within about five minutes at about 20°C. Gentle stirring or other agitation of the solution promotes a uniform, rapid reaction. Longer reaction times may be used if found necessary. Following the separation, if desired, of reaction by-products such as sodium nitrates, sodium chloride, and sodium carbonates (depending on the solvents and reactants used), the reaction mixture may be evaporated slowly in air or, more rapidly, through the use of a rotary evaporator or by freeze drying, as examples. After drying, the gallium complex or complexes will remain in solid form. Recrystallization can be accomplished, if desired, using a suitable solvent, including but not limited to chloroform, alcohols such as ethanol and methanol, ether, water, acetone, and mixtures containing such solvents. Suitable solvents will depend upon which particular gallium complex(es) and impurities are present, upon the impurities to be separated, and upon the temperature and other physical conditions.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">It is noted that the mentioned methods are not the only ones that can produce hydroxypyrones and gallium complexes with hydroxypyrones and that various alternative methods may be used as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Additionally, in preparing the neutral 3:1 complexes of gallium with 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone, a single 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone or a mixture of 3-hydroxy-4-pyrones can be used. However, preferably, only a single 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone is employed.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">With regard to the preparation of 3-hydroxy-4-pyrones which are used as starting materials in the preparation of the neutral 3:1 complexes of gallium with 3-hydroxy-4-pyrones, certain of these compounds<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> occur naturally and may be obtained by extraction from the natural sources. For example, maltol is found in the bark of the young larch tree (<i>Larix decidua</i> Mill.), and in pine needles, chicory, wood tars and oils, and roasted malt<sup>12</sup>. Certain of the 3-hydroxy-4-pyrones are available commercially, including maltol and ethyl maltol. Others can be made from pyromeconic acid as a starting material, which can be derived from the decarboxylation of meconic acid. Methods for preparing such other 3-hydroxy-4-pyrones are well known in the art. Additionally, it is noted that maltol and ethyl maltol are in widespread use as flavoring and fragrance-enhancing agents for foods, and have very low toxicities when taken orally.</p><heading id="h0009">3. <u>Pharmaceutical Compositions</u></heading><p id="p0038" num="0038">The methods of this invention are achieved by using a pharmaceutical composition comprising a neutral 3:1 complex of gallium with 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone and means to inhibit dissociation of said complex under acidic conditions in the gastro (stomach) portion of the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">As noted above, this invention is directed in part to the discovery that while the neutral 3:1 complex of gallium with 3-hydroxy-4-pyrones delivers gallium to the bloodstream from the gastrointestinal tract, this complex will dissociate under acidic conditions (generally at a pH of about 4 or less) such as those which can be present in the stomach to the less absorbable 2:1 and 1:1 complexes, together with free hydroxypyrone and ionic gallium. Accordingly, in order to maintain the orally delivered gallium in a form which is highly absorbable in the gastrointestinal tract, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention are formulated to contain a means to inhibit<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> dissociation of this complex when exposed to the acidic conditions of the stomach.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Means to inhibit or prevent dissociation of this complex when exposed to the acidic conditions of the stomach include the following preferred methods:<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>(1) Addition of a sufficient amount of a pharmaceutically compatible buffering agent to the 3:1 complex that would bring the pH of the stomach fluids to a range of from about 5-9 and preferably from about 6-7 so that the stomach fluids would no longer disrupt the 3:1 hydroxypyrone:Ga complex. <br/>Pharmaceutically compatible buffering agents are those which, while acting as a buffering agent, do not significantly alter the ability of the neutral 3:1 gallium complex to deliver gallium to the bloodstream of the patient and are not toxic either alone or in combination with the neutral gallium complex. The particular pharmaceutically compatible buffering agent employed is not critical. Examples of preferred pharmaceutically compatible buffering agents include, by way of example, calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) and the like. On the other hand, aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>, and other aluminum-containing compounds, by way of example, should be avoided. Other pharmaceutically compatible buffering agents are well known in the art and are recited in standard pharmaceutical manufacturing textbooks (e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences by Mack Publishing Company).</li><li>(2) Adding to the pharmaceutical composition containing the 3:1 complex an excess of free hydroxypyrone (or a salt thereof containing a physiologically acceptable cation), particularly the one used to make the 3:1 complex. Such a mixture, when dissolved in the stomach, has the effect of shifting<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> the equilibrium among the 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1 complexes towards a preponderance of the 3:1 complex. In this embodiment, the weight of the free hydroxypyrone incorporated into the formulation is preferably 0.1 to 100 times the weight of the 3:1 complex employed in the formulation, and more preferably 0.1 to 10 times. This method, by itself, is not highly preferred but may be used in conjunction with other methods to inhibit dissociation.</li><li>(3) Formulating the pharmaceutical composition that contains the 3:1 complex in delayed release form, so that a preponderance of the complex is not released until the intestinal tract is reached. An example of such a composition is to formulate the 3:1 complex with certain gels, preferably hydrogels such as a polymerized polyethylene glycol hydrogel, that adsorb the 3:1 complex and then release it after ingestion only very slowly while in the stomach. The preparation of such delayed release formulations, particularly those using hydrogels, is well known in the art.</li><li>(4) Most preferably, formulating or packaging the 3:1 complex in such a way that the release of the 3:1 complex is prevented or inhibited until the basic, or less acidic, conditions of the intestinal tract are reached. Specific preferred methods include:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>(a) Encapsulating the 3:1 complex in a material that is resistant to dissolution until the intestinal tract is reached, most preferably using a tablet or capsule that is enteric coated, or granules that are enteric coated, to inhibit or prevent release of the 3:1 complex until a pH greater than about 5 or 6 is reached. Enteric coating of tablets, capsules, and granules is well known in the art.</li><li>(b) Microencapsulating the 3:1 complex within liposomes, preferably made from phospholipids, that do not dissociate under the acidic conditions of the<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> stomach, but that will release the 3:1 complex in the higher pH conditions of the intestinal tract. Such liposomes are also well known in the art.</li></ul></li></ul></p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The most preferred method, enteric coating tablets, granules or especially capsules, is well known in the art. Such methods are described, for example, by Porter<sup>7</sup>, by Nagai et al.<sup>8</sup>, by Jones<sup>9</sup>, by Messora<sup>10</sup>, and by Porter<sup>11</sup>. Preferred materials for the enteric coating include, by way of example, cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, poly(vinyl acetate phthalate), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinates, poly(meth)acrylates, and, preferably, cellulose acetate phthalate/diethylphthalate. When capsules are coated, a plasticizer should be used (such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinates/triethyl citrate or especially cellulose acetate phthalate/diethylphthalate) to minimize brittleness in the coating and to inhibit cracking of the coating.

Such enhanced delivery of gallium by pharmaceutical compositions containing neutral 3:1 gallium complexes permit the use of less gallium per unit dose as compared to pharmaceutical compositions containing gallium salts while still providing efficacious blood plasma gallium concentrations. The use of less gallium while still achieving the requisite blood plasma gallium concentrations by the compositions of this invention provides a practical method for the oral delivery of gallium.

In this test, the complex was given to rabbits and compared to a solution of gallium nitrate. Six female New Zealand white rabbits weighing between 2.68 and 2.91 kg were used, and were not fed for 18 hours before starting the experiment. A suspension of the 3:1 gallium ethyl maltol complex in double distilled water was prepared with a concentration of 10 mg elemental gallium per 4 ml of suspension. A solution of gallium nitrate nonohydrate dissolved in double distilled water<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> was also prepared, which had a concentration of 10 mg elemental gallium per 4 ml of solution. A small amount of solid sodium carbonate was added to the latter solution to bring the pH up to about 6. Each of the two solutions was given to three rabbits by oral gavage (through a tube inserted through the mouth to the stomach) in the amount of 4 ml per kg of body weight. The stomach tubes were flushed by three ml of water following administration of the solutions.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Six ml of blood was taken from each rabbit at 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, and 24 hours following administration of the solutions, and the serum separated and frozen. Control samples of blood were taken 24 hours earlier. The frozen serum samples were then sent to an independent testing laboratory for determination of the gallium contents by graphite furnace atomic absorption analysis. The testing laboratory received numbered serum samples, and never had any knowledge of the experimental conditions used to produce the samples. The results of the analyses are indicated in Table 1. Due to uncertainties in the analytical procedures for gallium in serum, the relative proportions of gallium in the serum samples are considered more significant than the actual reported concentrations.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">It is seen from Table 1 that the gallium ethyl maltol suspension was absorbed in significantly higher amounts than the gallium nitrate suspension of equal volume and gallium concentration. It is important to note that no attempt was made to counteract the adverse effects of the 3:1 gallium ethyl maltol complex being exposed to the acidic conditions of the stomach. This study should therefore be considered to give a minimal value for the oral bioavailability of the gallium ethyl maltol complex compared to gallium nitrate.<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> <tables id="tabl0001" num="0001"><table frame="all"><title>Table 1</title><tgroup cols="3" colsep="1" rowsep="0"><colspec colnum="1" colname="col1" colwidth="52.50mm"/><colspec colnum="2" colname="col2" colwidth="52.50mm"/><colspec colnum="3" colname="col3" colwidth="52.50mm"/><thead valign="top"><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col3" align="center">Mean gallium content of rabbit serum (ng/ml).</entry></row><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" rowsep="0"/><entry namest="col2" nameend="col3" align="center">Rabbits treated with</entry></row><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1"/><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="center">Composition A (3 animals)</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="center">Composition B (3 animals)</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">pro-treatment</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="right">0</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">0</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="char" char=".">1 hour</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="right">90</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">51</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="char" char=".">2 hours</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="right">274</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">99</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="char" char=".">4 hours</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="right">260</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">118</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="char" char=".">8 hours</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="right">212</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">103</entry></row><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="char" char=".">24 hours</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="right">84</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">64</entry></row><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col3" align="justify">Composition A = Gallium ethyl maltol suspension<br/>Composition B = Gallium nitrate solution</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h0014">Example 3 -- <u>Preparation of gallium maltol</u></heading><p id="p0062" num="0062">Maltol is dissolved in chloroform to form a 0.75M solution, and gallium nitrate nonohydrate is dissolved in ethanol to form a 0.5M solution.

EP	0636181	B1	2000-11-29	en	DESCR	1	<p id="p0001" num="0001">This invention relates to the genetic improvement of plants by the use of recombinant DNA techniques. Particularly, but not exclusively, the invention relates to the improvement of the tolerance of plants to disease.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">From the beginning of agriculture humans have been confronted with the problem of plant disease. Throughout history many strides have been made against plant diseases as exemplified through the use of hybrid plants, pesticides and improved agricultural practices. However, as any farmer, home gardener, or house plant devotee can attest, the problems of plant disease are an ongoing and constant problem in plant cultivation. This invention constitutes a major step forward in solving the problem of plant disease by exploiting a long known fact regarding the method by which certain microbes, especially fungi, attack plants. Specifically, this invention addresses a means by which the etiologic (disease causing) agent is slowed or prevented from actually entering into the plant tissue, thereby preventing disease. Alternatively, in instances where complete invasion is not prevented the present invention confers upon plants a means for reducing the effects of infection thereby reducing or preventing plant mortality due to the disease.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In order for a plant pathogen to infect a plant, it must be able to gain access into and subsequently throughout the plant. Plant pathogens accomplish this in various ways. Generally, this is accomplished by the secretion of chemical substances that affect certain component and/or metabolic mechanisms of the plant to be attacked, i.e., the host for the pathogen. The main groups of compounds that are secreted by plant pathogens and that are related to the disease-causing mechanism are toxins, enzymes, polysaccharides and/or other effectors of growth. One such chemical compound is oxalic acid or oxalate which can be degraded by the enzyme oxalate oxidase. Although the reaction catalysed by oxalate oxidase is well-known, the physico-chemical attributes of the enzyme as exemplified by barley oxalate oxidase are incorrectly reported in the literature.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The secretion of oxalic acid as a means by which plant pathogens attack plant hosts is commonly found in a plurality of fungal genera and especially in the genera Sclerotinia, Sclerotium, Aspergillus, Streptomyces, Penicillium, Pythium, Paxillus, Mycena, Leucostoma, Rhizoctonia and Schizophyllum. These genera of fungi, especially those fungi of the genus Sclerotinia, are known to cause destructive and fatal diseases of numerous highly cultivated plants including field crops such as sunflower, soybean, beans in general, rape/canola, alfalfa, flax, safflower, peanut and clover, vegetable crops such as lettuce, tomato, cucurbits, potato, carrot, radish, pea, lentils, cabbage, broccoli and brussel sprouts, flowers such as petunia and pyrethrum and tree species such as peach.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The diseases include not only pre-harvest diseases in the field but also post-harvest diseases during shipping and storage.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The symptoms caused by the aforementioned fungal genera vary with the host plant and the parts of the host plant infected with the disease, as well as being dependent upon environmental conditions at the time of pathogen attack. For example, a feature of all Sclerotinia disease is wilting and collapse of the leaves<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> whereupon the fungus rapidly invades the "heart" of the plant and throughout the stem. The disease is fatal.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">In liquid cultures of Sclerotinia levels of oxalic acid ranging from a thousand to ten thousand parts per million, depending upon growth media, age of the culture and other parameters have been observed. Certain plant tissue such as leaves of bean and sunflower exposed to low concentrations of oxalic acid readily show signs of wilting and cell death suggesting the importance of oxalic acid in later stages of disease. The precise mechanism of the disease causing function of oxalic acid after infection is unknown although theories range from chelation of divalent metals interfering with plant cell walls and/or key metabolic enzymes to providing an optimum micro-environment for the action of hydrolytic enzymes secreted by these fungi. Regardless, it is clear from extant evidence that oxalic acid is an integral component of pathogenic attack. Evidence for this conclusion has been obtained by several studies including investigations with oxalate-minus Sclerotinia mutants that appear to possess the normal complement of hydrolytic enzymes and other factors but do not produce disease symptomology. Revertants of these oxalate minus mutants demonstrated normal disease development and characteristics.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The high degree of virulence of diseases associated with the aforementioned fungal genera are well-known. For example, leaves of greenhouse grown sunflower plants infected with Sclerotinia sclerotorum frequently exhibit wilting and interveinal necrosis three to five days after inoculation. Study of these plants has shown a wilt inducing substance in water extracts of hypocotyl (the part of the axis of a plant embryo or seedling below the cotyledon) lesions. Chemical tests including thin layer chromatography and gas-liquid chromatography have demonstrated that this wilt inducing substance contained oxalic acid and that wilted leaves from infected plants contained over fifteen times more oxalic acid than leaves of healthy plants. As already noted, the oxalic acid moves systemically through the plant to cause disease symptoms in tissues that are both distant from the initial point of infection and not necessarily infected with fungal hyphae.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">With this backdrop, the inventors realised that appropriate identification, isolation and expression of an oxalate degrading enzyme such as an oxalate oxidase, oxalate decarboxylase or similar enzyme by a plant might well diminish the pathogenicity of fungi which secrete oxalic acid as a key component of pathogenicity. Accordingly, the inventors set out and achieved the goal of properly identifying and isolating a gene for a protein that is suitable for the introduction of oxalate oxidase activity into plants and microbes using the techniques of genetic engineering.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Oxalates also occur commonly in some plant species as products naturally produced by the plant itself. Naturally-occurring oxalate accumulates in some green leaf vegetables such as spinach and rhubarb and in some forage legumes.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Although such crops species potential sources of dietary vitamins and minerals, ingestion of large amounts is toxic to humans where it binds with calcium ion and precipitates, as insoluble calcium oxalate in the kidneys leading to hyperoxaluria and degradation of renal tissue.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">It is also known that oxalic acid may react with other plant metabolites to form oxalate derivatives which are highly toxic. In one example the compound b-N-oxalyl-L-a-b-diaminopropionic acid is formed which is a neurotoxin.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Thus, the presence of oxalic acid in some plant species rules out their use as human or animal food.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In particular, the inventors have characterised an enzyme useful in thwarting pathogenicity involving oxalic acid. This uniquely characterised oxalate oxidase enzyme catalyzes or otherwise contributes to a reaction involving the oxidative degradation of oxalate to produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide. The general form of this reaction is:<chemistry id="chem0001" num="0001"><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="80" he="9" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The study of this enzyme has resulted not only in its identification, isolation and expression, but, also in its characterisation and its cloning so that a gene for expression of the enzyme is extant, can be introduced into plants, and expressed by plants thereby conferring disease resistance to fungi in which oxalic acid is a critical component. Such plant transformation would protect the transformed plants against the deleterious disease causing effects of oxalic acid.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">It will be appreciated that the applications of the aforementioned inventions are not limited to plant pathogenesis. Still another benefit of this invention is the introduction of an oxalate oxidase gene into a plant to produce a low oxalic acid plant. This could be especially beneficial in high oxalate plants such as peanuts, beets, spinach, rhubarb, barley, cocoa, and many grasses. See, Libert and Franceschi (1987), J/ Agric. Food Chem., 35:926-938. Also, the invention has application for the large scale production of oxalate degrading enzymes. The need for such large scale oxalate degrading enzymes is known in a variety of fields including the need for their use in assay kits to determine the presence and/or amount of oxalic acid and for use in the degradation of oxalic acid present in foodstuffs, beverages and commercial processes. For example, the microbial oxalate decarboxylase has been used by the brewing industry (U.S. Patent No. 4,652,452) and as set forth herein oxalate can also be degraded using oxalate oxidase.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">An object of the present invention is to provide means for the degradation of oxalic acid in plants.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to the present invention there is provided a method of imparting the ability to degrade oxalate to a plant comprising inserting into the genome of the said plant by genetic transformation a gene encoding an oxalate oxidase.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Preferably the the plant genome is transformed by a gene construct having a promoter sequence, a transit peptide, a structural gene sequence encoding said oxalate oxidase enzyme and a gene terminator sequence.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In a preferred embodiment the structural gene sequence comprises the DNA sequence of Figure 1.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The present invention also provides a method of combating plant pathogenesis by infection with a fungus which secretes oxalic acid, comprising stably incorporating into the genome of said plant by transformation a gene encoding oxalate oxidase.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The said fungus may be of a genus selected from the group of oxalic acid secreting fungi comprising Sclerotinia, Sclerotium, Aspergillus, Streptomyces, Penicillium, Pythium, Paxillus, Mycena, Leucostoma, Rhizoctonia, and Schizophyllum.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">Most preferably the fungus is <i>Sclerotinia sclerotorum</i>.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In a preferred application of the invention the plant is sunflower <i>(Helianthus annuus)</i><!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The invention also provides a plant derived therefrom having stably incorporated within its genome by transformation a gene encoding oxalate oxidase and also a plant cell having stably incorporated within its genome by transformation a gene encoding oxalate oxidase.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Thus, in general terms, the present invention is broadly directed to the understanding and appreciation of the use of an oxalate degrading enzyme as exemplified by oxalate oxidase for commercial uses such as in the brewing industry or for agronomic uses such as to reduce susceptibility of a plant to oxalic acid or to reduce the endogenous oxalic acid concentration in a plant. The inventors have come to appreciate and teach herein, particularly for agronomic application, the use of oxalate degrading enzymes to reduce plant mortality or destruction from diseases or other phenomenon in which oxalic acid plays a critical invasive role. The inventors have also appreciated that use of this invention can result in the prevention of plant mortality and infection from diseases in which oxalic acid is critical. Such diseases are particularly caused by, among others, the specific genera of fungi set forth herein.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The appreciation of the inventor's novel uses of oxalate degrading enzymes is especially enhanced by the realisation and invention of the inventors that the physico-chemical properties of barley oxalate oxidase as reported in the literature was inaccurate. Accordingly, the inventors have substantially purified and characterised on oxalate oxidase enzyme not heretofore described. Indeed, the purported substantial purifications of the enzyme as set forth in the literature are shown herein to be incorrect. Specifically, the inventors disclose a substantially pure oxalate oxidase having a particular total amino acid composition, shown in Figure 2, a pH optimum of 3.5, a neutral isoelectric point, a positive heat stability, protease stability and a single subunit of approximately 25 kilodaltons.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Also set forth herein is the invention of substantially all of a substantially pure gene encoding an oxalate oxidase enzyme with a specific DNA sequence as shown in Figure 1. The gene encodes the oxalate oxidase enzyme having the characteristics as set forth above. In particular the gene encodes an enzyme exhibiting oxalate oxidase activity having a single subunit of approximately 25 kilodaltons, that reacts specifically with antibodies raised against purified barley oxalate oxidase, and has an amino acid sequence shown in Figure 2.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">A transformed plant cell is also disclosed herein, which cell is transformed by a gene encoding the expression of oxalate oxidase or another oxalate degrading enzyme. The gene encoding such enzyme can include the DNA sequence set forth in Figure 1, which substantially corresponds to the oxalate oxidase enzyme substantially purified by the inventors.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The purified oxalate oxidase of this invention, its use as an agent to fight pathogenesis and its use in plant cell transformation provide an innovative and unique approach to the control of plant diseases in which oxalic acid plays a critical component either during pathogenesis or at the invasive stage. It is, of course, well-known that the activity of the enzyme oxalate oxidase is that it contributes to the degradation of oxalic acid. However, it was the current inventors who first appreciated that by attacking the oxalic acid by chemical degradation, for example by enzymatic degradation, a significant agricultural benefit in conferring disease resistance against those diseases in which oxalic acid plays a critical role would result. This invention holds special promise because a major scourge in the commercial<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> cultivation of agronomically important plants, for example crops such as sunflowers, is caused by fungal species such as Sclerotinia that secrete oxalic acid.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Although the prior art reportedly purified oxalate oxidase and characterised it, the inventors have discovered that such literature reports were inaccurate and that the enzyme was, in fact, never properly purified and characterised. It will be appreciated that as used herein, "oxalate oxidase" refers to the purified and characterised form of the enzyme as set forth herein unless stated otherwise. The differences between the extant literature reports and the purified and characterised enzyme of the current invention are set forth in detail herein and can be briefly gleaned from Table 1.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The impurity of commercially available oxalate oxidase preparations as well as the improper characterisation of the enzyme in the literature was evident when the inventors first purified oxalate oxidase from barley seedling root. Two procedures were used. In one instance purification of the barley seedling root oxalate oxidase involved homogenisation of frozen tissue in 1 to 4 volumes of water and purification from the aqueous extract following filtration though cheesecloth to remove debris. The solution was further purified by centrifugation at 18,000 g for 30 minutes followed by heat treatment at 80°C for 3 minutes with the precipitates at both steps being discarded; protein precipitation from the supernatant between 30% and 70% saturation with respect to ammonium sulphate (NH4)2SO4 was collected by centrifugation and was dialyzed against water. Protein resolubilizing from the ammonium sulphate precipitation step was fractionated on a Pharmacia FPLC using a Mono S 10/10 column equilibrated with 25 mM potassium acetate pH 4.8 eluted with a 0.0 to 0.4 M NaCl gradient in the same buffer. Oxalate oxidase activity was measured by the method of Sugiura, et al (1979), Chem. Pharma. Bull. 27(9):2003. Peak fractions of oxalate oxidase activity were combined, equilibrated with the low salt potassium acetate pH 4.8 buffer and re-chromatographed on the FPLC using a Mono S 5/5 column eluted with the buffers and NaCl gradient as above. Peak fractions from the Mono S 5/5 step were combined, equilibrated with 25 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.6 applied to a Mono Q 5/5 column and eluted with a 0.0 to 0.4 m NaCl gradient. Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of peak oxalate oxidase activity fractions showed prominent protein bands upon silver staining at approximately 25 and 38-40 kilodaltons.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Subsequent size fractionated of the native protein on a Superose-12 gel filtration column (equilibrated with 50 mM potassium acetate, pH 4.8) on the FPLC showed a well-defined peak of activity eluting at a time corresponding with the molecular weight of about 25,000. No oxalate oxidase activity was found eluting in any other fractions associated with other molecular weights.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">A second method involved the use of detergent extraction. Four to seven day old barley seedling roots were powdered in the presence of liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. Storage under these conditions resulted in no apparent loss of activity. The stored tissue was homogenised with distilled water containing 0.5% taurodeoxycholate sodium salt, filtered and centrifuged. Oxalate oxidase assays on the two fractions (supernatant and pellet) reveal that both fractions possessed activity. Accordingly, the pellet was extracted with distilled water containing 0.5% taurodeoxycholate. Following exhaustive dialysis against distilled water, ammonium sulphate was added to concentrate and fractionate the soluble supernatant probe. The precipitated proteins (30-70% ammonium sulphate fractions) were then resuspended in a small volume of distilled water containing detergent and desalted on a small gel<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> permeation column (Sephadex G25). The active fraction was applied to an anion exchange column (DEAE) using a Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 buffer and elution of bound protein effected using a sodium chloride gradient. The enzymatically active fraction was concentrated, desalted and then applied to a Mono-Q column (Pharmacia). A sodium chloride gradient was again employed to elute the proteins. Activity assays showed that the oxalate oxidase was concentrated in 3 fractions. Upon analysis of these fractions by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the activity was determined to be associated with a polypeptide of about 25 kilodalton molecular weight.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Following purification, characterisation of the purified, homogeneous oxalate oxidase preparation was effectuated. As already indicated and as shown in Table 1 the properties of the protein resulting from this purification plainly differ from that described in the literature. This suggests that despite attempts by others skilled in the art to purify the oxalate oxidase enzyme, it was not until the present efforts of the inventors that this enzyme was properly described and fingerprinted through the elucidation of its physico-chemical properties. The results of the physico-chemical characterisation undertaken by the inventors are set forth in Table 1. By way of comparison, the previously reported literature characterisation of the enzyme is also set forth. <tables id="tabl0001" num="0001"><table frame="all"><title>TABLE 1</title><tgroup cols="3" colsep="1" rowsep="1"><colspec colnum="1" colname="col1" colwidth="52.50mm"/><colspec colnum="2" colname="col2" colwidth="52.50mm"/><colspec colnum="3" colname="col3" colwidth="52.50mm"/><thead valign="top"><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col3" align="center"><b>OXALATE OXIDASE PROPERTIES</b></entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">Property</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left"><b>Literature</b></entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="left"><b>Invention</b></entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">pH optimum</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left">3.5</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="left">3.5</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">Heat Stability</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left">+</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="left">+</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">Subunit No.</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left">2</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="left">1</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">Size</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left">75k</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="left">25k</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">pI</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left">2.8</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="left">approx. 7</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">Cofactors</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left">-</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="left">-</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">Protease Sta</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left">unknown</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="left">+</entry></row><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">Membrane association</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left">unclear</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="left">+</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Further establishing the distinctiveness of the inventors' enzyme exhibiting oxalate oxidase activity can be seen in Table 2.

The recovered enzymatically active protein was further purified by preparative sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A single protein band of about 25 kilodalton molecular weight band was detected and subsequently sliced from the gel.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The wet gel slices were fragmented, mixed with Freund's adjuvant and injected intramuscularly into the rear of the thigh muscle near the hip of the rabbits. The rabbits were boosted with additional quantities of protein and sample bleeds monitored to assure the production of oxalate oxidase specific antibodies. After about four months the animals were exsanguinated. The polyclonal rabbit antibodies produced were of very high titer.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The gene encoding for barley-derived oxalate oxidase having the structure shown in Figure 1, was cloned as shown in Figure 4 using a cDNA library constructed from barley root. Total RNA was prepared from barley root. Polyadenylated RNA was then recovered from total RNA and used for the synthesis of cDNA. Both total and polyadenylated RNA were prepared using commercially available RNA extraction and mRNA purification kits according to the standard instructions provided with the kits (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc). Construction of the library was commercially performed (Clontech Laboratories). The vector chosen for the library was lambda gt 22. Use of this expression vector was selected based on the high titer and specificity of the oxalate oxidase antiserum. Whatever the expression vector selected for use with this conversion, it is advantageous for the vector to permit the use of an immunological screen for the protein product of oxalate oxidase cDNA clones. Base on the average insert size of 1.8 kilobases for the cDNA library and good representation as far as number of independent clones (1.7 x 106), it was deduced that the library should contain a cDNA clone for the oxalate oxidase protein approximately 25 kilodaltons in size.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The initial screen of the library was performed with antiserum to oxalate oxidase according to standard procedures as, for example, set forth in Huynh, T., et al., (1985) DNA Cloning Techniques: A Practical Approach, D. Glover, ed. IRL Press, Oxford. Since information on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the mature oxalate oxidase protein had been obtained (except for the N-terminal residue), the N-terminal sequence was also used to confirm the identity of any cDNA clones recovered as positive in the initial immunological screen. 1.2 x 106 plaques from the cDNA library were screened with the antiserum. Fourteen potentially positive signals were obtained one of which was much stronger than the others. Two sequential rounds of re-screening with the antiserum were performed on these fourteen clones in order to obtain confirmed positive, single plaque isolates which would be<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> characterised at the molecular level. Plaque number 12 again gave the strongest signal throughout these subsequent screens. Plaque number 12 was then used to purify the oxalate oxidase antibody as a test of the specificity of the plaque signal, according to the standard procedure as described, for example, in Hunyh, T. et al., supra. Antibody purified from plaque 12 was used as a probe on a Western blot of an acrylamide gel of oxalate oxidase protein. The plaque-purified antibody reacted specifically with oxalate oxidase, showing a pattern identical to that seen with purified antibody as a probe. The insert (cDNA product cloned into the vector lambda gt 22) from plaque 12</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">was recovered using standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods as exemplified in Ausubel, F.M. et al., eds., (1988). "The Polymerase Chain Reaction", in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley Interscience, New York, pp. 15.0.1-15.4.6. The insert in plaque number 12 was estimated to be 650-750 base pairs. The size of the insert in plaque 12 was consistent with a protein of about 25 kd. Based on the initial size estimate for the cDNA insert and the result from plaque purification of the antibody, plaque number 12 was considered to be the best candidate for further molecular analysis. The number 12 insert prepared by PCR was then recloned into a plasmid vector more amenable to analysis. The cDNA insert from clone 12 was also used as a probe to a Northern blot of barley root RNA to estimate the size of the mRNA for oxalate oxidase. Formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and transfer to a nylon membrane were carried out according to the procedures recommended by the commercial supplier of the membranes, Schleicher and Schuell. The number 12 probe hybridised to a single mRNA species approximately 800-850 bases long.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Dideoxy nucleotide sequencing was performed on the recloned plaque 12 insert. A commercially available T7 sequencing kit (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc.) and the manufacturer's recommended procedure were used. The barley cDNA insert was determined to be approximately 690 bases long with some uncertainty in two small regions covering no more than ten base pairs each, the c terminus and the identity of the three N terminal bases. The nucleotide sequence of the clone 12 insert is shown schematically in Figure 1. The partial protein sequence was then predicted from the nucleotide sequence of clone 12 and compared to the N-terminal amino acid sequence obtained directly from the purified oxalate oxidase. This comparison is shown in Figure 3.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The gene having the structure shown in Figure 1 containing the coding sequence for the mature oxalate oxidase enzyme would be attached to genetic regulatory elements which are needed for the expression of the structural gene in a defined host cell. The first type of regulatory element required is a gene promoter region, which contains DNA sequences recognised by the biological machinery of the plant cell and which induces transcription of the DNA sequence into messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA is then translated into the protein produce codes for by the structural gene region. The promoter is attached in front of or 5' to the gene for oxalate oxidase, which can be performed according to standard methods know in the art. See, for example, T Maniatis, et al., (1982) Molecular Cloning, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York, pp. 104-106. Promoter regions which could be used for expression of the oxalate oxidase gene in plant cells include promoters which are active in a wide range of different plant tissues. For example, the 35S promoter from the cauliflower mosaic virus may be suitable for this purpose. Another type of<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> promoter that could be used in plant cells is one which expresses under more restricted conditions. Included in this class would be promoters active only in certain tissue(s) of the plant and/or induced to be active by certain stimuli like wounding. An example of this kind of promoter would be the 5' regulatory region from the gene for phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL). This type of promoter is discussed in Liang, X. et al., (1989), PNAS, USA, 8:9284-9288. Expression of the oxalate oxidase gene in microbial hosts could be achieved by use of promoters obtained from microbial sources. Examples of such promoters would include the trp promoter for expression in bacteria such as E. Coli as exemplified in Amann, E., et al., (1983) Gene, 25: 167-178, or the glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD) promoter for expression in yeast as exemplified in Edens, L. et al, (1984), "Synthesis and Processing of the Plant Protein Thaumatin in Yeast," Cell 37:629-633. The gene promoter sequences may also be derived in part or in whole from promoter sequences found in cells unlike those of the host cell as long as they meet the above criteria for transcription and translation.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">A second genetic regulatory element which desirably could be, but need not be, attached to the oxalate oxidase gene is a terminator or polyadenylation sequence which promotes effective termination of transcription of the gene and, in eukaryotes, also promotes polyadenylation, ie, the addition of any number of adenosine nucleotides at the 3' end of the mRNA. Standard methods known in the art can be used to attach the terminator region behind or 3' to the gene. (See, for example, T. Maniatis, et al, supra, pp. 104-106). An example of such a terminator/polyadenylation sequence for expression in plants would be that from the octopine synthase gene from an <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> Ti plasmid as enuciated in H. DeGreve et al., (1982), "Nucleotide sequence and transcript map of the <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> Ti plasmid-encoded octopine synthase gene", J. Mol. Appl. Genet., 1:499-511. An example of such a terminator for expression in microbial hosts is the rho-independent transcription terminator sequence from <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>. See, for example, M.E. Winkler, (1987), "<i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>: Cellular and Molecular Biology", F.C. Neidhardt, ed-in-chef; American Society for Microbiology. The gene terminator sequences may also be derived in part or in whole from terminator sequences found in cells unlike those of the host cell, as long as they meet the above criteria for transcription termination and polyadenylation required by the host cell.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Another type of regulatory element which may be attached to the gene for oxalate oxidase is a DNA sequence coding for a signal peptide. The signal peptide is attached to the amino terminus of the protein and permits the protein to be localised to the cell wall or secreted from the host cell. During this localisation process, the signal peptide is cleaved off, producing a protein product with the sequence of the mature protein. The DNA sequence for the signal peptide is inserted between the promoter and the coding region. Standard methods known in the art may be used to attach the DNA sequence for the signal peptide (See, for example, Maniatis, T., et al., supra, pp. 104-106). Examples of such signal sequences would include the signal peptide from an extension gene of plants (Chen, J. and Varner, J.E., an extracellular matrix protein in plants: characterization of a genomic clone for carrot extension". EMBO J 4:2145-2151, 1985) from the bacterial pelB (pectate lyase) gene of <i>Erwinia carotovora</i> (Lei, S.P. et al., (1987), J. Bacteriol. 169 4379) and from perpro factor of yeast (Smith, R.A., et al., Science 229:1219-1229, 1985). The signal peptide sequences may also be<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> derived in whole or in part from terminator sequences found in cells unlike those of the host cell, as long as they meet the above criteria for processing and localisation of the protein in the host cell.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Any of the various methods known for introducing foreign genes into plants could be used for insertion of the oxalate oxidase gene into a host plant. The methodology chosen to accomplish plant transformation with the oxalate oxidase gene would vary depending on the host plant. By way of example, one well-characterized methodology that would be useful for plant transformation with the oxalate oxidase gene would be Agrobacterium mediated transformation.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Agrobacterium mediated transformation using the oxidase gene follows the procedures well-known for this methodology. First, a gene cassette suitable for expression in plants is introduced into a disarmed strain of <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> as an intermediate host. The oxalate oxidase gene cassette is introduced into the T-DNA region of a recombinant plasmid containing a selectable marker gene such as a gene encoding for neomycin phosphotransferese II, phosphinothricin acetyl transferase or the like. This methodology is set forth in many literature publications including Horsch, et al., (1985),. "A Simple and General Method for Transferring Genes Into Plants", Science 227:1229-1231. Pieces of plant tissue, eg leaf, cotyledon or hypocotyl are co-incubated with the bacteria for 2-3 days before the bacteria are killed using antibiotics such as carbenicillin. Additional antibiotics corresponding to the selectable marker gene employed are included in the plant tissue culture medium such that only transformed plant cells will grow.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Plants regenerated from the transformed cells are then tested for the presence and expression of the oxalate oxidase gene. Immuno assays and test for oxalate oxidase activity can be used to identify individual transformants. Tolerance to exogenous oxalic acid can also be used as a functional test of intact tissues.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">As noted, several other methodologies are available for plant transformation apart from Agrobacterium transformation. Examples of these other DMA delivery methods include electroporation, ie chemically induced delivery into protoplasts, micro-injected, biolostics as well as others. An example of a type of plant that is not especially suitable for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation are soybean and certain cereals including maize. These plants would plainly benefit from plant transformation attempts using methodologies other than Agrobacterium-mediated transformation.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">The drawings which accompany this description are as follows:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>Figure 1 shows a cDNA sequence reverse engineered from the mRNA coding for barley seedling oxalate oxidase.</li><li>Figure 2 shows the amino acid sequence translated from the cDNA shown in Figure 1.</li><li>Figure 3 shows diagrammatically the cloning strategy used to clone the oxalate oxidase gene and described in detail in Examples 1 and 2 hereinbelow.</li><li>Figure 4 shows diagrammatically the cloning strategy described in Examples 3 and 4 below.</li><li>Figure 5 shows the structure of plasmid pVB1, and,</li><li>Figure 6 shows the structure of plasmid pBin19i.</li></ul></p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The invention will now be described, by way of illustration, in the following Examples.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><heading id="h0001"><b>EXAMPLE 1</b></heading><p id="p0052" num="0052"><b>Construction of an oxalate oxidase non-secretion vector for tomato transformation.</b></p><heading id="h0002"><b>(a) Reconstruction of a full length oxalate oxidase open reading frame (ORF).</b></heading><p id="p0053" num="0053">Oligonucleotides 1219901A and 1219901A(compl) were designed and synthesised to form a linker with a HindIII site at the 5' end and a BsaI site at the 3' end.oligo 1219901A:5'-<img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="151" he="21" img-content="dna" img-format="tif"/></p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into clone #22 cut with HindIII and partially with BsaI to produce the clone pOXOX1 containing the mature oxalate oxidase ORF as indicated by peptide sequencing.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">After cloning of the HindIII/BsaI linked into clone #22, the integrity of the mature oxalate oxidase ORF was confirmed by DNA sequencing.</p><heading id="h0003"><b>(b) Insertion of the oxalate oxidase ORF into an expression vector.</b></heading><p id="p0056" num="0056">The mature oxalate oxidase coding region was isolated from agarose as a 700 bp HindIII/BamHI fragment and the ends were made blunt with T4 DNA polymerase. pNB33A was cut with XbaI and PstI, the vector fragment was isolated from agarose and the ends made blunt with T4 polymerase.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">These two blunt ended fragments were ligated together to produce the clone pNBOXOX1.

EP	0605422	B1	2000-03-08	en	DESCR	1	<heading id="h0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The need for preventing inadvertent needle sticks has been recognized for many years. For example, U.S. Patent No. 2,571,653 to Bastien shows a syringe in which the barrel of the syringe is mounted within a protective sheath. The sheath can be placed at different axial positions relative to the barrel, one exposing the needle for use and one covering the needle for safety. Many other safety syringe assemblies have been developed as well (see in particular document GB-A-2202747). However, one of the problems with the prior art safety syringe assemblies is that they generally cannot be used with conventional syringes, are awkward to use and make calibrations and volume graduations difficult to see clearly. Also, existing safety syringe assemblies often are not economical to produce; this is especially true when the syringe structures are intended to be disposable.</p><heading id="h0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">The present invention is directed to a syringe assembly, particularly useful for use with conventional prefilled pharmaceutical cartridge-needle units, including a hollow body housing the cartridge-needle unit or other syringe structure. The hollow body and the syringe structure include mating positioning elements to permit the syringe structure to be secured at one or more axial positions within the body. The positioning elements are preferably radially extending recesses and extensions. The hollow body typically has at least two internal recesses sized and positioned to engage a radially extending member carried by the syringe structure so that the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> needle can be partially or totally exposed for use and then withdrawn into the body for safety. The body is configured so that when the user squeezes the body at positions diametrically adjacent the recess, the radially extending member becomes disengaged from the recess due to the deformation of the body. This frees the needle permitting it to be repositioned within the body.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The body is constructed so that the body may be deformed to permit the radially extending member to freely move from the recess to permit the syringe structure and body to move axially relative to one another. This may be achieved by constructing the body with an elliptical cross-sectional shape and forming pairs of the recesses through the walls of the body while constructing the radially extending member as an annular, outwardly extending ring carried by the syringe structure. The radially extending member can be disengaged from the recesses by squeezing the body to deform the body from the generally elliptical shape to a generally circular shape. Preferably, three sets (or four sets to permit one molded body to accommodate both short and long needle lengths) of axially spaced-apart recesses are provided. One recess near the distal end of the body for I.M. (IntraMuscular) injections. An intermediate recess (or two to accommodate both long and short needle cannula) such that the tip of the needle is within the interior of the body may be used for safer disposal. Also, this position may be used for I.V. (IntraVenous) port injection. By properly sizing the opening at the distal end of the body, the body may be placed over the injection valve of an I.V. port, permitting the sharpened point of the needle cannula to pierce the membrane port only after this sharpened point has been shielded from human contact. This permits I.V. port injection with a high degree of safety and efficacy. The recess or recesses closest to the plunger end of the body are used to ensure the needle tip is well within the body for safe disposal of the syringe structures.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">One of the primary advantages of the invention is that it permits the needle of a syringe structure to be safely housed within the body in an extremely simple and cost<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> effective manner. In addition, although the invention can be used with conventional syringes, the invention finds particular utility when used with prefilled pharmaceutical cartridge-needle units. In such case, the body can be part of an enclosure unit, the enclosure unit acting as both the protective packaging for the cartridge-needle unit, and also as a part of the operational syringe assembly itself.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Other features and advantages will appear from the following description in which the preferred embodiments have been set forth in detail in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p><heading id="h0003">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p0006" num="0006"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>FIG. 1 is a side

id="h0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p0007" num="0007">FIG. 1 illustrates a one-piece molded enclosure unit 2, preferably made from clear polypropylene or polyethylene. Enclosure unit 2 includes elongate, substantially hollow body section 4 having a needle end 6, a<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> plunger end 8 and defining an interior 10 therein. Unit 2 also includes an end section 12 frangibly connected to plunger end 8 at frangible connections 14. End section 12 includes a cap 16 connected to the remainder of end section 12 by an integral hinge 18 to permit the end 20 of end section 12 to be oriented and sealed as suggested in FIG. 4.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Enclosure unit 2 also includes an adapter 22 extending from needle end 6 and attached thereto by frangible connections 24. Adapter 22 has a circumferentially extending adapter ring 26 sized to engage specially positioned pairs of body slots 28, 29, 30 formed in body section 4. The method and purpose for doing so will be discussed below. Finally, enclosure unit 2 also includes a hollow stem section 32 frangibly attached to adapter 22 by frangible connections 34. Stem section 32 is hollow to accommodate a sheathed (typically sterile) needle (see FIG. 4) and also has a threaded tip 36 to permit stem section 32, once removed from adapter 22, to be secured to a piston to create a plunger as suggested in FIG. 5. Adapter 22 is moved from the position of Fig. 1 to that of Fig. 3 by forcing stem section 32 in the direction of arrow 35, thus severing frangible connections 24, until ring 26 engages slots 28. Body section 4 includes a shoulder 37 at needle end 6. Shoulder 37 helps to keep adapter 22 from inadvertently passing back out of interior 10. Shoulder 37 may be a continuous shoulder, or it may be formed as diametrically opposed segments.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">FIG. 2 illustrates a set 38 of enclosure units 2 molded as a one-piece item and secured to one another through frangible connections 40 at needle end 6 of body section 4 and by frangible connections (not shown) extending between the finger grips 42 at plunger ends 8. As discussed in the above-referenced application, set 38 of enclosure units 2 acts as both the protective shipping and storage container for cartridge-needle units 46, shown in Fig. 4, as well as providing other functions as discussed below.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">FIG. 4 illustrates enclosure unit 2 with a conventional cartridge-needle unit 46, such as one made by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories of Radnor, Pennsylvania, under the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> trademark TUBEX, mounted therein to create a syringe assembly 48 in its as-shipped condition. Cartridge-needle unit 46 is of the type including a barrel 50 containing a flowable material, typically a liquid, and having a piston 52, typically initially at the plunger end 54 of barrel 50. A needle assembly 56 is mounted to the needle end 58 of barrel 50. Needle assembly 56 includes a needle 60, having a sharpened tip 62, and a hub 64 used to mount needle 62 barrel 50. An elastomeric sheath 65 is used to cover needle 60 and seal tip 62. Hub 64 is secured within the interior 66 of adapter 22 through the engagement of a lip 68 (see FIG. 3) with the plunger facing edge 70 of hub 64. As suggested by arrow 72, once cartridge-needle unit 46 is mounted within enclosure unit 2, cap 16 is pivoted to close end 20 and is sealed in place, such as with an irreversible mechanical lock which is also tamper-resistent and tamper-evident, an adhesive or with heat or ultrasonic welding techniques. The thickness of cap 16 is sufficient to resist tampering with the contents of barrel 50 while syringe assembly 48 is in its as-shipped condition of FIG. 4. To further inhibit tampering, an internal metal shield could be used.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">To use syringe assembly 48, stem section 32 is fractured from adapter 22, typically with a twisting action, and tip 36 is secured to piston 52, typically with a threading action as suggested by arrow 74 in FIG. 5. Next, sheath 65 is removed and the injection is given by driving plunger 76, made up of stem 32, piston 52 and thumb plate 53, as shown by arrow 78 of FIG. 6.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The present invention permits needle 60 to be withdrawn back into body section 4 in a simple, straightforward manner. As shown in FIG. 7A, body section 4 has an elliptical cross-sectional shape with body slots 28 positioned through the walls of body 4. This permits the outer circumference of adapter ring 26 to enter body slots 28 so long as body section 4 is in its normal, typically undeformed condition of FIG. 7A. To disengage adapter ring 26 from body slots 28 thereby permitting its axial movement, the user 79 squeezes body 4 as suggested by arrows 80 in FIG. 7B opposite body slot 28. The appropriate place to squeeze body section 4 is further aided by<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> the provision of three different sets of tactile bumps 82, 83, 84, shown in FIG. 2, opposite body slots 28, 29 and 30. Once body section 4 has been sufficiently deformed to release adapter ring 26, cartridge-needle unit 46 can be moved axially relative to body section 4 from the I.M. injection position of FIG. 6 to the I.V. injection position of FIG. 8, at which adapter ring 26 engages body slots 29. As can be seen in FIG. 8, body slots 29 are positioned so that tip 62 of needle 60 is within interior 10 of body section 4, but near needle end 6. Doing so permits syringe assembly 48 to be easily and safely used to inject a liquid into or withdraw a liquid from a membrane valve 86 of a conventional I.V. port 88 as shown in FIG. 8. The opening at needle end 6 is sized to properly guide injector arm 86 while eliminating any substantial possibility of an inadvertent needle stick during such a procedure.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">FIG. 9A illustrates the engagement of adapter ring 26 within body slot 29. At FIG. 9B a modified adapter ring 26a is shown with a tapered plunger-facing surface 90. The use of surface 90 keeps adapter ring 26 snug within body slot 29 and also provides a ramp effect to make movement of adapter ring 26a towards plunger end 8 of body section 4 easier.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">FIG. 10 illustrates a syringe assembly 48a identical to syringe assembly 48 but with a needle 60a being longer than needle 60. To properly position tip 62 relative to needle end 6, adapter 22 is positioned along body section 4 until adapter ring 26 engages body slots 30 rather than body slots 29.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">FIGS. 12a and 11 illustrate further embodiments providing for the proper positioning of tips 62 of needles 60, 60a (the short and long needle versions, respectively). Short needle 60 is used with a conventional width adapter ring 26 as in FIG. 8. However, with syringe assembly 48b, shown in FIG. 11, extra width adapter ring 26b is used. Adapter ring 26b will engage body slots 28a, 29a and 30a but will not engage narrow width body slots 29. However, normal width adapter ring 26 can engage all of the body slots 28a, 29, 29a and 30a. Therefor, adapter ring 26b is repositioned from body slots 28a, past body slots 29 and into engagement with body slots 29a so to properly position tip 62. With syringe assembly 48c, shown<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> in FIG. 12, adapter ring 26 is initially positioned within body slots 29a (although somewhat loosely). Movement of adapter ring 26 from body slot 28a towards plunger end 8 allows adapter ring 26 to engage body slots 29 and thus properly position tip 62 in this case as well. FIG. 12b shows the use of an I.V. drip visual indicator 91 between body slots 29, 29a to show the user which body slot is to be used for use with an I.V. port 88. Other visual indicators or markings could be used adjacent the body slots used for I.M. injections and safe disposal.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">FIGS. 13-16 illustrate another method by which different length needles can be accommodated, and also demonstrate that adapter ring 26 need not be a full circle. Syringe assembly 48d, illustrated in FIG. 13, uses a short length needle 60 while syringe assembly 48e uses long length needle 60a while both use a body section 4b. Body section 4b includes a pair of body slots 28, a single body slot 29b, a single body slot 29c and a pair of body slots 30b formed in a plunger end 8a. As can be seen in FIG. 14, adapter ring 26c is generally C-shaped and is sized to substantially impede or prevent rotation of adapter 22b within interior 10 of body section 4b when engaged within the body slot 29b. The axial and rotary position of body slot 29b is chosen to properly position tip 62 of needle 60. Similarly, with reference to FIGS. 15 and 16, adapter 22c has its adapter ring 26d positioned 180° from adapter ring 26c of FIG. 14 so that adapter ring 26d engages body slot 29c rather than slot 29b so tip 62 of needle 60a is also properly positioned relative to needle end 6 of body section 4b.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In both embodiments of FIGS. 13 and 15, plunger end 8a is thickened or strengthened. This helps to rigidify body section 4b at body slots 30a so that once adapter rings 26c, 26d enter body slots 30a, it will be quite difficult to squeeze plunger end 8a of body section 4b with sufficient force to disengage the adapter ring from the body slot.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">FIGS. 17, 18A and 18B illustrates a situation in which the body slots 28, 29 and 30 are replaced by flanges 92, 93, 94 which engage an annular slot 96 formed in adapter 22d. The disengagement of flanges 92 from slot 96 occurs in the same<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> manner as discussed with reference to FIGS. 7A and 7B. That is, the user squeezes body section 4c as shown by arrows 80 to cause the disengagement of flanges 92 from slot 96. This permits the relative axial movement of adapter 22d within body section 4c so to reposition needle 60 within the interior 10 of the body section.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">FIG. 19 illustrates a still further alternative embodiment of the syringe assembly 48 of FIG. 4. Syringe assembly 48f is similar to syringe assembly 48 except that adapter 22 is replaced by providing an adapter ring 26e as an integral part of hub 64a. This eliminates the need for adapter 22, but likely requires modification of a conventional cartridge-needle unit.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Turning now to FIGS. 20 and 21, a syringe assembly 48g is shown adapted for use with a smaller sized cartridge-needle unit 46a. One distinction between syringe assembly 48g and syringe assembly 48 is the use of an extended length adapter 22e, a portion 98 of which extends past finger grips 42 to permit user 79 to grasp portion 98 when placing the assembly into an I.V. injection or a safe disposal condition.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Body section 4c of syringe assembly 48g includes a pair of inwardly biased fingers 100 having protrusions 102 shaped to conform to the outer surface of portion 98 of adapter 22e. This helps to center adapter 22e, and cartridge-needle unit 46a therewith, within interior 10 of body section 4c. Fingers 100 could also be used to center and stabilize cartridge-needle unit 46 in the other embodiments.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Other modifications and variations can be made to disclosed embodiments without departing from the subject of the invention as defined in the following claims. For example, the invention is particularly adapted for use with a cartridge-needle unit. However, the invention is also adaptable for use with syringes and can be used with separately packaged cartridges and cartridge-needle units as well. While most of the disclosed embodiments use an elliptically shaped body section, the body section could, however, be another shape, such as generally triangular, as well. The deformation of the body section could also be created by twisting or rotating the<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> adapter ring (or other radially extending member) to cause the radially extending member to disengage from a body slot. However, doing so would require the appropriate rotary manipulation of the pieces in addition to axial manipulation. While enclosure unit 2 is, in the preferred embodiment, a one-piece molded structure, it may be desireable to make it from two or more pieces. For example, it may be desireable to make adapter 22 and cap 16 as separate pieces. Also, it may be desired to mount adapter 22 to hub 64 prior to positioning the cartridge-needle unit within the body section.</p>

EP	0614422	B1	2000-03-22	en	DESCR	1	<p id="p0001" num="0001">This invention relates generally to suspension systems for land vehicles and, in a preferred embodiment thereof, to a liquid spring suspension system in which the spring and damping characteristics of each liquid spring are computer adjusted, during vehicle operation, in response to sensed variations in liquid spring and vehicle operating parameters.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Various proposals have been made for replacing the conventional hydraulic shock absorber and exterior coil spring assemblies in vehicular suspension systems with more compact devices known as liquid springs. A conventional liquid spring includes a cylindrical housing having an internal chamber with a compressible liquid therein, a piston reciprocally disposed in the chamber, a rod structure secured to the piston and axially movable into and out of the chamber, and having an external strut projecting outwardly of one of the housing ends. With the liquid spring operatively interconnected between the vehicle frame and an associated wheel support structure, the compressible working liquid generates both spring and damping forces in the suspension system in response to relative axial translation between the rod structure and housing of the<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> liquid spring caused by relative vertical displacement between the wheel and the frame.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The compressible working liquid permits the system to exhibit a non-linear force/deflection curve. This non-linear behavior is important because it offers lower spring rates during normal operation and higher spring rates when the vehicle strikes a bump. Non-linearity in the system is provided by the compressibility of the silicone-based working liquid, which is approximately 1.5 to 2 times more compressible than conventional hydraulic fluid. In operation, the non-linear system provides a spring rate which increases exponentially when the strut moves from its normal static position to full compression. This increase permits the suspension unit to absorb sharp bumps without bottoming out. In contrast, if the spring rate were linear, a substantially greater piston stroke would be required to enable the suspension unit to absorb comparable bounce forces.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Conventional liquid spring suspensions can be tuned and readily adjusted for differing vehicle weights (springing force) and different ride characteristics (dampening). It will be appreciated that non-linear struts that utilize a compressible working liquid for both springing and dampening have a potential for superior performance.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Various arrangements have been proposed for selectively adjusting the spring force and/or damping force characteristics of liquid springs to settings which remain essentially constant during vehicle operation until readjusted when the vehicle is at rest. These essentially fixed spring force and damping force characteristics represent at best compromise settings adapted to handle an often wide range of road conditions and vehicle operational inputs (such as steering input, braking forces, vehicle<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> speed and the like) encountered during operation of the vehicle.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Conventional non-linear suspension systems, for example gas-over-oil systems, are too bulky and heavy for certain commercial and military vehicles. There is a continuing interest in reducing the size and weight of such non-linear suspension systems, as well as improving the operational performance.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Examples of the general structure and operation of a liquid spring incorporated in a vehicular suspension system are disclosed in the following U.S. patents:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>4,741,516   4,877,222</li><li>4,735,402   4,652,008</li></ul></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">UK Patent Application No. 2,159,604 discloses an adjustable hydraulic damper having a working chamber divided into upper and lower chambers. The upper and lower chambers are permitted bypass flow to a compensating chamber when an extension phase valve is extended. A modulation chamber is coupled to an external pressure source for modulating the pressure of the various chambers. There is a fixed tube which guides a piston assembly, but its upper end is not sealed against a control tube partially filled with compressed gas and oil. The working chamber is not divided into bounce and rebound chambers, as defined in Applicant's described<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> embodiments.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The principal object of the present invention is to provide an improved liquid spring vehicular suspension system in which the spring force and damping force characteristics of the liquid springs are automatically adjusted, during vehicle operation, to compensate for variations in both road conditions, vehicle load changes and vehicle operational inputs, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">In a particular embodiment, illustrative of the present invention, and to be described below, by way of example, the spring and damping force characteristics of each liquid spring of a vehicular suspension system are continuously computer adjusted during vehicle operation in response to sensed variations in either or both liquid spring and vehicle operating parameters.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Each liquid spring of the particular embodiment has a main cylinder housing having a pressure chamber formed therein in which a dual piston assembly is reciprocally disposed and axially divides the main pressure chamber into bounce and rebound chambers. The dual piston assembly includes a support piston secured to the main housing and<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> coaxially disposed within the main pressure chamber. A separation piston head is coaxially secured to the static support piston and is slidably and sealingly engaged against the main housing chamber bore for axial movement relative thereto into and out of the pressure chamber. The separation piston head is secured to a tubular piston which includes a tubular strut portion which projects outwardly of the housing and which has a longitudinal bore defining a pressure modulation chamber.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">A compressible working liquid is disposed within the bounce and rebound chambers and within the pressure modulation chamber of the tubular piston. An annular flow passage is defined in the annulus between the static support piston and the tubular piston. Flow transfer ports are formed radially through the tubular piston closely adjacent the rebound chamber side of the separator piston head, and radially extending flow transfer ports are formed through the static support piston in communication with the bounce and rebound chambers, respectively. The static support piston is intersected by a longitudinal flow passage which is coupled in flow communication with the bounce and rebound chambers by the flow transfer ports. A rotary metering valve is interposed between the bounce and rebound chambers and is independently operable to respectively meter compressible liquid flow therebetween. The piston modulation chamber is coupled in flow communication with the bounce chamber through a check valve.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Each of the liquid springs has its cylinder housing piston secured to an associated wheel structure, and has its strut secured to the vehicle frame in a manner such that vertical deflection of the wheel structure relative to the frame causes relative axial displacement between the rod structure and the housing and causes the compressible working liquid to exert spring and dancing forces that yieldingly and reactively resist vertical wheel displacement. Control means are provided and are respectively operable to selectively and independently operate the rotary metering valve to meter compressible liquid flow through the piston rod ports, to selectively vary the effective volume of<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> the compressible liquid and to selectively vary the pressure of the compressible liquid in the bounce and rebound chambers by modulating the pressure of the compressible liquid in the modulation chamber.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Means are provided for generating liquid spring operating parameter signals including a first signal indicative of the relative axial position of the piston within the housing chamber, and a second signal indicative of the compressible liquid pressure in the bounce chamber.

The liquid spring 12 is adapted for attachment at its upper end to a vehicle frame F, and at its lower end to the axle spindle 16 of its associated wheel 14. The liquid spring 12 is operable to provide the requisite suspension spring and damping<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> forces at each wheel location. As described below, the liquid spring 12 is controlled by a computer 18 which continuously and automatically adjusts key operational aspects of the liquid spring 12 in response to sensed variations in selected vehicle and liquid spring operating parameters.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The liquid spring 12 includes an elongated main cylinder housing 20 having an upper housing end 20A and a lower housing end 20B. A spherical bearing 22 is secured to the lower housing end 20B and is connected to the wheel support structure 16 as shown in Figure 4. A spherical bearing 24 is secured to a cylindrical housing boot 26 in which the main housing 20 is telescopically received. The spherical bearing assembly 24 is adapted for attachment to a vehicle frame (not shown). An annular gland member 28 is connected into the upper housing end 20A of the main cylinder housing 20 by a threaded union T. Interposed between the gland 28 and the upper housing sidewall 20A is an annular, elastomer seal 30. The main cylinder housing 20 has a cylindrical bore 22 which defines a pressure chamber 34 for receiving compressible silicone-based working liquid.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">A dual piston assembly 36 is reciprocally disposed in and axially divides the main pressure chamber 34 into a bounce chamber 38 and a rebound chamber 40. The dual piston assembly 36 includes a static support piston 42 which is secured to the lover end 20B of the main housing 20 and is coaxially disposed within the main pressure chamber 34. A separation piston head 44 is coaxially secured to the static support piston 42 and is slidingly and sealingly engaged against the main housing chamber bore 32 for axial extension and retraction movement relative thereto into and out of the pressure chamber 34. The separation piston head 44 is sealed against the main housing chamber bore 32 by an annular seal 46. The separation piston head 44 is attached to a tubular piston 48 having a longitudinal bore 50 defining a pressure modulation chamber 52. The tubular piston 48 has a tubular strut portion 485 projecting outwardly of the main cylinder housing 20 and is mechanically connected to the housing boot 26 and the spherical<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> bearing 24.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The upper end of the support piston 42 is received in telescoping engagement within the bore 50 of the tubular piston 48. As can best be seen in Figure 3, a damping flow annulus 54 is formed between the overlapping end portions of the static support piston 42 and the tubular piston 48. The annulus 54 between the static support piston and the tubular piston is sealed by an annular gland seal 56. The tubular piston 48 is sealed against the bore of the annular housing gland 28 by an annular gland seal 58. A flow port 60 is formed through the head of the tubular piston 48 and is engaged by a hydraulic fitting 62 for permitting the flow of compressible working liquid into and out of the pressure modulation chamber as indicated by the double arrow 64.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The tubular piston 48 and separator piston head 44 are thus extendable into and retractable out of the main cylinder chamber 34 in response to differential pressure conditions which are imposed within the bounce chamber 38 relative to the rebound chamber 40, and relative to the pressure modulation chamber 52.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The deflection position of the separation piston head 44 is detected by a position sensor 66 which is mounted onto the housing boot 26. The position sensor 66 carries a conductor which forms one plate of a capacitor, while the second plate of the capacitor is formed by a tapered conductive strip 68 attached to the external side surface of the main cylinder housing 20. The capacitance produced by the sensor plate and the tapered conductor strip 68 varies substantially linearly as the sensor head is moved along the tapered strip. The effective capacitor value produced by this arrangement forms a portion of an electronic bridge circuit which generates an electrical analog output signal 70 which is directly proportional to the radial displacement of the sensor head 66 from the tapered strip 68. Since the strip 68 has a linear taper, the radial displacement of the sensor plate is directly proportional to axial displacement of the sensor head from a reference position D<sub>0</sub> (Figure 2). The analog electrical output signal 70 forms one of the vehicle operating parameter<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> signals which is input to the computer 18.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Interchamber flow communication between the bounce chamber 38 and the rebound chamber 40 is provided by flow transfer ports 72 which are formed radially through the static support piston closely adjacent the lower housing end portion 20B on the bounce chamber side of the piston, and by flow transfer ports 74 which are formed radially through the static support piston closely adjacent the upper housing end portion 20A on the rebound chamber side of the separator piston head 44. The upper flow transfer ports 74 are in flow communication with the damping flow annulus 54. The flow transfer ports 76 are formed radially through the tubular piston 48 closely adjacent to the rebound chamber side of the separator piston head, in flow communication with the rebound chamber 40 and with the damping flow annulus 54. The static support piston 42 is intersected by a longitudinal flow passage 78 which is in flow communication with the radial flow ports 72 and the bounce chamber 38, and also in flow communication with the upper flow transfer ports 74 and damping flow annulus 54.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">According to one aspect of the invention, a variable flow restrictor 80 is interposed between the bounce chamber 38 and the rebound chamber 40. Preferably, the variable flow restrictor 80 is a rotary metering valve which is independently operable to meter compressible liquid flow from the bounce chamber 38 to the rebound chamber 40, and from the rebound chamber 40 to the bounce chamber 38, respectively. The metering valve 80 includes a D.C. electrical stepping motor 82 having a rotor 82R mounted for rotation about a tubular mandrel 84.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Connected to the rotor 82R for rotation on the tubular mandrel 84 is a metering valve body 86 having axially extending peripheral passages 86A, 86B which, upon appropriate rotation of the rotor 82R, may be moved into and out of metering registration with the flow transfer ports 74 to thereby selectively meter compressible liquid flow between the bounce chamber 38 and the rebound chamber 40. The rotor 82R of the stepping motor 82 is rotatable through nine step increments of ten degrees each so that<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> the valve body metering passages are selectively positionable from partially open (maximum damping), as shown in Figure 5, to fully open (minimum damping).</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The tubular mandrel 84 has a central bore 88 disposed in flow communication with the flow passage 78 and extends longitudinally through the support piston 42. The metering valve 80 is mounted within a counterbore 90 which is formed in the upper end of the static support piston 42. The metering valve assembly 80 is confined within the counter bore 90 by a threaded retainer cap 92. D.C. electrical power for operating the stepping motor 82 is provided by a conductor 94 which is routed through a longitudinal bore 96 formed through the sidewall of the support piston 42. The piston rod 42 and the main housing cylinder 20 form the D.C. return conductor.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">A check valve 98 is mounted within a pocket in the retainer cap and is spring loaded to close a discharge flow passage 100 and is yieldable to connect the pressure modulation chamber 52 in fluid communication with the central bore 88 of the tubular mandrel 84 in response to a predetermined pressure differential. According to this arrangement, a positive pressure differential in the pressure modulation chamber 52 relative to the bounce chamber 38 causes the check valve 98 to open and thereby permit the bounce chamber 38 to be pressurized to the pressure level of the pressure modulation chamber 52. The check valve 98 is thus operable to permit one way interchamber flow from the modulation chamber to the bounce chamber 38, but blocks reverse flow.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The tubular piston 48 is slidably and sealingly engaged against the annular housing gland 28, and the slidable union is further sealed by an annular wiper seal 102. The rebound chamber is further sealed by an O-ring seal 104 which is mounted in an annular slot 106 formed in the housing gland 28. Impact forces applied by the separator piston 44 against the annular housing gland 28 are reacted by a resilient bounce pad 108.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">When the vehicle is at rest, the portion of its weight supported by the wheel structure and the liquid spring 12 exerts<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> a downward axial force on the tubular piston 48 which tends to force the separator head 44 further into the main pressure chamber 34, thereby reducing the volume of the bounce chamber 38. Downward movement of the separator piston also reduces the volume of the pressure modulation chamber, thereby compressing and pressurizing the working liquid within the pressure modulation chamber 52.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">As the separator piston 44 strokes downwardly, the compressible working liquid is forced through the flow ports 72 upwardly through the flow passage 78 where it is discharged through the rotary metering valve 80 into the flow transfer ports 74, 76. When the net upwardly directed fluid pressure on the face of the static support piston 42 and on the face of the separator piston 44 equals the load of the vehicle weight born by its wheel structure, the tubular piston 48 is at a vertical equilibrium deflection paint D<sub>1</sub> within the main pressure chamber 34 (Figure 3). This equilibrium point established the ride height of the vehicle when it is at rest or travelling along essentially level terrain.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">When an additional, upwardly directed bounce force is imposed on the wheel structure, the main cylinder housing 20 is moved further upwardly along the tubular piston 48 and the flow of compressible working liquid is metered through the metering valve 80 to equalize the pressures in the bounce and rebound chambers. According to an important feature of the invention, the pressure of the bounce chamber 38 is modulated by flow from the pressure modulation chamber 52 to restore the deflection of the separator piston 44 to a desired ride height D<sub>1</sub>. This is accomplished by the computer 18 which receives the analog signal 70 which is representative of the instantaneous ride height deflection. In response to the ride height deflection signal 70, as well as other vehicle operation parameters, the computer 18 directs an increase or decrease in the pressure of the pressure modulation chamber 52 by directing the flow of compressible working liquid from a accumulator through a proportional flow control valve 112 and a<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> directional flow control valve 114. The accumulator 110 is charged from a compressible liquid reservoir 115 by a hydraulic intensifier 117.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Referring now to Figure 6, the load deflection response of the liquid spring 12 is illustrated. In this example, the piston of the liquid spring 12 is at a vertical equilibrium deflection point A, which corresponds with a stroke deflection D<sub>1</sub> of three inches, and a precharged pressure level P of about 1800 psi in the bounce and rebound chambers. In response to a bounce impact, and in the absence of a modulating pressure, the tubular piston 48 will stroke through the main pressure chamber 34, with the operating point following along the non-linear load deflection curve X. Without pressure modulating compensation, the piston will continue its stroke until bottoming occurs. However, upon the application of a high pressure boost of compressible liquid from the pressure modulation chamber 52 through the check valve 98 into the bounce chamber 38, the piston stroke is reversed at point B, with the tubular piston 48 being retracted until equilibrium is reached at the desired ride height deflection D<sub>1</sub> at point C on the load deflection curve Y. As the bounce forces are reacted, the pressure within the bounce chamber equalizes with the pressure in the rebound chamber, thereby causing the operating point to return to point A on the load deflection curve X. The load deflection curves X, Y generally define the limits of an operational load deflection envelope. The operating point A can be established and maintained at any point within the operational envelope by appropriate modulation of the pressure level within the modulation pressure chamber 52.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The proportioning flow control valve 112 is controlled by a flow rate control signal 116 generated by the computer 18. The proportioning control valve is driven by a pilot actuator 118. The pilot actuator 118 moves a shuttle within the valve to provide flow rate proportioning control of compressible liquid from the reservoir 110 to the directional control valve 114 from a first position in which its inputs are fully blocked, to a second<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> position in which both input ports are fully open to receive pressurized working liquid from the reservoir 110, to a third position which one output port is vented and one output port is blocked. The three position, four way proportioning control valve 112 is also operable to provide continuously variable flow rate control from fully closed (blocked) to fully open (vented).</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The directional flow control valve 114 is responsive to computer control signals 120, 122 for selectively charging the bottom port 124 which is in flow communication with the bounce chamber 38, while venting the top port 60 which is in flow communication with the modulation chamber 52 in a first position, and is movable to a second position in which the bounce chamber 38 is blocked and the modulation chamber 52 is open to receive pressurized working liquid from the accumulator 110, and movable to a third position in which the pressure modulation chamber 52 is charged and the bounce chamber 38 is vented to permit pressurized working fluid to be returned to the hydraulic supply reservoir 110.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">According to this arrangement, the directional control valve 114 is operable to switch the flow through the hydraulic conduits 62, 126 so that the pressure modulation chamber 52 can be switched from charge to discharge, and the bounce chamber 38 can be switched from charge to discharge according to computer control. Moreover, both the pressure modulation chamber 52 and the bounce chamber 38 may be charged at the same time and both can be blocked at the same time. The pressure modulation chamber 52 and the bounce chamber 38 can be selectively blocked or opened for charging and venting, as determined by the vehicle operating parameters.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The vehicle operating parameters include input signals developed by a manually/automatic settable ride height controller 128, a vehicle speed transducer 132, a steering transducer 134, a braking force transducer 136 and a manually settable damping controller 138. The ride height controller 128, the vehicle speed transducer, steering transducer, brake transducer, ride height<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> sensor and manual damping controller each produce analog signals which are subsequently digitized by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for input to the computer 18. The computer 18 receives these analog and digital vehicle operating parameter signals and generates control signals to the proportioning flow controller 112 and the directional flow controller 114, as well as a D.C. metering control signal 140 which is electrically connected to the power conductor 94 by a connector 142 (Figure 1) and applied to the electrical stepping motor of the metering valve 80 for automatically adjusting the spring and damping characteristics of the liquid spring 12 to maintain a desired ride height deflection.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The use of the proportioning flow control valve 112 and directional flow control valve 120 in conjunction with the pressure modulation chamber 52 and the bounce chamber 38 permits the bounce and rebound damping characteristics of the liquid spring 12 to be selectively, independently and quickly varied over a wide adjustment range. For example, with the metering valve 80 rotated to its maximum position relative to the flow control ports 74, 76 the damping forces on the static support piston 42 and the tubular piston 48 are at their minimum magnitudes, with the valve body 86 being positioned at its least restrictive setting. At the other extreme of the damping range, when the metering valve body 86 is in its fully closed position as shown in Figure 5, the available bounce and rebound damping forces are maximized. Between those two extremes are an infinite number of relative valve positions and correspondingly available bounce and rebound damping force settings.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Not only may the metering flow be variably restricted by the metering valve 80, but the pressure modulation chamber 52 and the bounce chamber 38 may be selectively charged or vented and opened or closed with respect to the output of the proportioning flow controller valve 112, whereby the bounce chamber 38 can be modulated instantaneously by pressure changes in the pressure modulation chamber 52 to further modify the damping<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> characteristics of the liquid spring 12. This permits the pressure modulation chamber 52 to be used, for example, to store compression energy as the housing 20 is deflected in one vertical direction, and to release the stored compression energy as the housing deflects in the opposite vertical direction.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Operation of the liquid spring 12 is uniquely controlled during vehicle operation by the control input signals 128 (ride height setting), 132A (vehicle speed), 134A (steering), 136A (braking rate), 138A (manual damping) and 70 (deflection height). The deflection signal 70 which is transmitted tram the position sensor 66 has a magnitude which is proportional to the deflection distance D<sub>1</sub> (Figure 3) as measured from the fully extended position D<sub>0</sub>, and is therefore indicative of the axial position of the piston head 44 relative to the opposite ends of the main cylinder pressure chamber 34.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">According to this embodiment, both the spring force characteristics and the bounce and rebound damping characteristics of the liquid spring 12 are continuously monitored and automatically varied in response to variations in the vehicle operating parameters and the deflection operating parameter of the liquid spring itself. For example, the previously described continuous sensing of the deflection position of the piston head 44 enables the computer 18 to compute, at any given instant, the direction of relative travel of the piston 48, its velocity, and its acceleration relative to the main cylinder housing 20, and responsively vary the controller signals 116, 120 to the proportioning flow control valve 112 and the flow direction control valve 114 to substantially instantaneously adjust the effective piston velocity and/or acceleration during either a bounce or rebound stroke of the wheel 14. It will be appreciated that the suspension system 10 may be conveniently utilized to continuously and automatically adjust the spring and damping characteristics of the liquid spring 12 to generally optimize the suspension performance over a wide range of road conditions the vehicle may encounter at any given instant.<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --></p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The suspension system 10 takes full advantage of the instantaneous compliance and compressibility of the silicone compressible working liquid. Because of the compressible nature of the silicone working liquid, the suspension system 10 can respond faster to bounce impulses than gas/oil systems because the silicone working liquid does not require hydraulic flow before compliance can occur. The instantaneous reaction and greater damping power reduces not only the magnitude of impact but also significantly reduces the number of sequential impact cycles transmitted to the frame, which improves all aspects of handling and ride comfort. Moreover, the improved suspension system 10 is characterized by lighter mass weight and package size, thereby providing lighter unsprung weight which further enhances ride handling characteristics.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The improved suspension system 10 is thus capable of carrying a wide range of loads and of varying the load force relationship of the liquid spring slowly and instantaneously to permit a vehicle to travel over rough courses with the suspended chassis remaining stable and comfortable. The system thus accommodates large variations of static and dynamic loading with reduced dynamic affect on the suspended chassis. The suspension system has the ability to sense the movement of the piston strut 48 including its direction, its instantaneous position and acceleration, and modifies the damping function and bounce or rebound to maximize its reduction of transmitted force to the chassis and thereby improve ride comfort.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The ride height sensor signals are read by the computer which generates appropriate output signals the proportional flow controller and the directional flow controller valves to produce the desired pressure force and the required damping level to optimize the chassis ride. For a four wheeled vehicle, the outputs of the four load ride height deflection sensors represent the chassis dynamic motions and describe the heave, pitch, roll and warp modes of the chassis relative to the road. The suspension system 10 uses the damping force to counteract the<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> acceleration forces and produces an increase or decrease in the modulation of the spring forces to reduce or increase the displacement at the appropriate strut to affect a more stable ride over an uneven course.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The liquid spring suspension units function both as a spring and as a shock absorber in which both functions are capable of modulation within desired ranges to increase or decrease damping to provide harder or softer performance and increase or decrease the spring force to respond to dynamic road conditions, unsprung mass and chassis motions to effectively reduce the chassis dynamic motions and to produce a smoother, more comfortable ride. The signal from the ride height sensors at each strut are sensed by direction and position in relation to a desired ride height, thereby providing real time adjustment by the computer. The ride height position signals are continuously monitored and are used in the control system to compare to other struts indicating chassis, heave, roll and warp modes of operation and corrective damping and spring forces are instantaneously modified within the struts to obtain the desired ride and vehicle control.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">It will be appreciated that the suspension system 10 provides greater damping force capability and the ability to change spring force rapidly. This provides improved performance capability over prior art suspension systems. Moreover, the suspension system of the present invention simplifies assembly by reducing both the numbers and complexity of the liquid spring components. The overall system cost and weight are reduced correspondingly. Moreover, improved ride quality is provided over a greater load variation, thereby reducing friction and improving reliability. Consequently, many of the factors which have impeded the development of practical dynamic ride control suspension systems have been overcome.

The liquid spring of the present<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> invention may be installed in other suspension configuration, such as the double wishbone (A-frame) configuration of Figure 7. The sensing of the piston deflection position may be achieved by other means, for example by a photoelectric position sensor, a magnetoresistive sensor, or an inductive sensor.

EP	0674732	B1	2000-08-16	en	DESCR	1	<p id="p0001" num="0001">This invention relates to composite blocks such as paving blocks used to construct roads, parking lots, driveways and the like, and preformed slabs used for buildings and the like.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">In North America, and indeed in most of the civilized and populated areas of the world, roads have become an integral part of cities, towns, suburbs, and so on. Indeed, most towns and cities contain hundreds or thousands of miles of roads within their boundaries, and also driveways or parking lots for virtually every building within a city or town.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The conventional way and indeed the most popular way to provide roads, driveways, and parking lots with a top surface is to use asphalt for the top surface. A best estimate is that several million miles of roads and several million acres of parking lots within North America are surfaced with asphalt.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">However, there are two fundamental problems with asphalt. One problem is that asphalt is oil based, or at least largely so, and therefore a raw material that is in limited supply is being used when it could be being used for other purposes. Secondly, there is a question of durability, which is now generally recognized as a very significant problem. Many existing roadways and parking lots, even very new ones, are degraded considerably largely due to broken asphalt, and cracks or potholes can be found at any given time. The amount of asphalt roadway in North America that has asphalt damage is quite extensive. Most of the damage is caused by weather cycles, which cause expansion and contraction of the asphalt. Any roadway that does not have asphalt damage has most likely been constructed or repaired in the last few years. This is generally unsightly and also quite expensive. Further, oil and other fluids that drip from vehicles while the vehicle is parked or in motion also cause a<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> significant problem. The amount of damage that is done by oil and other fluids from vehicles is considerable. This damage can be seen in virtually every parking lot, driveway, and roadway intersection in North America. Not only does the oil, or whatever fluid that might be leaking from a vehicle, leave a very unsightly stain on the asphalt surface of a roadway, parking lot or driveway, the asphalt surface in time will start to degrade to a point where it is crumbling and needs to be replaced.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">While it is possible to replace small portions of the asphalt surface, at least in most cases, this leaves an unsightly patch -- or indeed several patches -- of new asphalt.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">One alternative that has been recently fairly widely accepted in North America as an alternative for resurfacing driveways and small parking lots is interlocking blocks. Interlocking blocks are made of a cementitious or a cement based material having a small relatively constant sized aggregate therein. These blocks come in various shapes and sizes. Basically, these blocks interfit with one another such that the blocks can be installed on a surface to completely cover the surface. The blocks may need to be cut around the perimeter of a surface in order to fit exactly to the outline of the surface. Among the advantages of interlocking blocks are that they do not require the same heavy equipment to install as it takes to create a surface of asphalt, they are easy to replace, only the damaged blocks need replacing which can be done relatively quickly and inexpensively, and they last much longer than an asphalt surface and are much more resistant to damage -- including weathering, impact, and leaking oil. They are, however, more expensive to install initially than an asphalt surface, although the cost factor can be spread over many more years since interlocking blocks are much more durable than asphalt. Further, it generally takes longer to install a given area of interlocking blocks than to pave the same area with asphalt, which adds to the initial cost. Largely because of the lower initial cost, many parking lots and driveways are still paved with asphalt instead of surfaces with interlocking blocks. However,<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> because of the long term cost benefits, it is becoming more and more acceptable to use interlocking blocks even where cost is an important and an accountable factor, such as in municipal roads and parking lots or shopping mall and office complex parking lots.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Another advantage of interlocking blocks is that they can, in most cases, allow for ground movement without breaking. The blocks merely shift slightly with respect to one another or in some cases separate slightly from one another, which is usually acceptable. Further, moisture can pass between interlocking blocks which means that normal water seepage into the ground is not interfered with significantly.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Another problem with the present interlocking blocks is that they are concrete based and therefore somewhat porous. This means that they can absorb water which tends to cause them to crack or break during the winter.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The prior art includes basically asphalt surfaces and interlocking paving blocks made mainly of cement based materials.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">However, several patents relating generally to the subject matter hereof are discussed below, for the record:</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">U.S. Patent 1,740,212 discloses a bituminous composition and the manufacture thereof. This bituminous composition comprises an admixture of rubber with bituminous cement. Further, an admixture of fibre is added thereto.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">U.S. Patent 3,253,521 a flexible paving composition wherein to surface a roadway, a rubberized bituminous adhesive is applied to the surface and then a cover of paving composition is applied thereto, while the adhesive is in a condition to adhere the composition to the surface. The paving composition comprises a mixture of rubberized bitumen and particulated rubber.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">U.S. Patent 3,891,585 discloses an elastomeric pavement repair composition wherein asphalt is heated and rubber is combined therewith. The resulting<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> composition is mixed to form a hot jellied composition which can be applied to cracked or distressed pavements.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">U.S. Patent 4,284,366 discloses an elastomeric composite pavement wherein a molded paving unit is formed as a composite of a resilient base material and a friction aggregate. The particles of the aggregate are disposed in the base material throughout the thickness of the paving unit. The resilient base material includes a binder material such as rubber -- more specifically EPDM. Alternate layers of friction aggregate and elastomeric binder material are laid into a cavity to form the molded paving unit.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">U.S. Patent 4,427,818 discloses a thermoplastic polymer concrete structure and method wherein a thermoplastic polymer concrete block is constructed of contaminated thermoplastic resin scrap, and fill material. The fill material may include sand particles, fibrous particles such as threads, and other waste materials such as metal chips. The mixture is heated and mixed and then placed into molds of a desired shape, and ultimately cooled.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">U.S. Patent 4,868,233 discloses a polyethylene modified asphalt wherein certain linear polyethylene compounds are added to an asphalt that is low in asphaltenes but relatively high in saturates. The resulting composition has excellent storage stability, face compatibility and creep resistance relative to unmodified asphalts. The improved asphaltic composition is particularly well suited for use as a binder in paving materials and as a coating or saturant for roofing products.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In U.S. Patent 4,873,275 it is disclosed that paving asphalts (especially of the hot mix, hot laid type) may be modified so as to have improved stability and rheological properties by the addition of certain co-polymers of ethylene with a vinyl acetate or lower alkyl esters of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid to the asphalt, provided the asphalt has an<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> asphaltene content below a critical level. More specifically, an asphalt cement or binder having both enhanced storage stability and creep resistance relative to conventional binders is formed when the asphalt used in the binder has an asphaltene content of about 7% (by weight) or less, based on percentage of weight of the asphalt. One embodiment disclosed provides an improvement in paving structures wherein the binder in the structures comprises an asphalt containing about 7% (by weight) or less asphaltenes and from about 3.5% to about 10% (by weight) of a co-polymer of ethylene, and from 3% to about 30% (by weight) vinyl-acetate, alkyl acrylate or alkyl methacrylate. Another embodiment of the invention incorporates into the asphalt used in the binders, from about 3.5% to about 10% by weight of a co-polymer of ethylene which contains from 3% to about 30% (by weight) vinyl-acetate, alkyl acrylate or alkyl methacrylate. The composition disclosed in the patent is said to be particularly suitable for use as a binder in the load bearing course as well as the top or surface course of pavement structures, particularly hot mix pavement structures.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">U.S. Patent 4,882,373 discloses that an asphaltic composition comprising a mineral acid, a thermoplastic elastomer and an unsaturated functional monomer, has improved tensile properties relative to that obtained in the absence of the unsaturated functional monomer.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Japanese Patent Publication 57-66206 discloses a method of manufacturing asphalt by using a hot asphalt mixture combined with a pasty rubber composition. The rubber composition consists of a 2:1 to 1:3 mixture of a rubber latex and a powdery polyolefinic polymer, having a melt index of 20 to 400 and a grain size of 0.3 m.m. or less.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">In the prior art, it is not disclosed to use both an elastomeric material and a polyethylene material in the same asphalt mix. Further, the use of a fibre material interspersed within the asphalt the polyethylene mixture is not contemplated. Moreover, the prior art does not contemplate to use the materials in the prior art to form blocks or the like to use as elements for paving or similar.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The present invention provides a moulded block which can be used in the surfacing and re-surfacing of roads, parking lots, sidewalks and other walkways, airport runways and tarmacs, and the like. The moulded blocks of the present invention are to be used substantially in the same manner as presently available interlocking blocks.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided composite blocks comprising asphalt in a proportion of about 25% to about 55% by volume, polyethylene in a proportion of about 10% to about 40% by volume, monofilament fibre material in a proportion of about 5% to about 35% by volume, and elastomeric material in a proportion of 5% to about 30% by volume.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The proportion of the materials that make up the composite material must of course add up to 100%.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Use of these components to form a resulting composite material provides a block that is extremely strong, durable, resistant to cracking and chipping, and so on.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Preferably, the moulded paving blocks of the present invention will be in the shape of a rectangular prism -- basically the same shape as a typical brick that is used in the construction of a building. Other shapes can of course be manufactured and used.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The materials used are preferably previously used materials such as reclaimed asphalt, recycled plastic such as polyethylene containers, reclaimed elastomeric material such as rubber from scrap tyres, and reclaimed monofilament fibre material such as nylon, rayon, or KEVLAR™ cords from scrap tyres. The materials<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> may also be new materials. There are many advantages of using reclaimed or recycled materials such as reduction of waste and also lower cost of raw materials.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The preferred proportional amounts of materials include asphalt in a proportion of about 40% by volume, polyethylene in a proportion of about 25% by volume, monofilament fibre material in a proportion of about 20% by volume, and elastomeric material in a proportion of about 15% by volume.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The asphalt should generally be the main or prevalent constituent of the composite material that forms the composite block of the present invention. The asphalt provides the mass and strength of the composite material due to the aggregate within the asphalt. Further, the asphalt contains resins composed largely of hydrocarbons. These hydrocarbons intermingle and bond with the plastic, which is preferably polyethylene, thus creating a binding agent within the material. Further, the plastic physically stabilizes the asphalt and therefore precludes deformation due to extreme temperatures. The monofilament fibres act to reinforce the binding agent thereby providing additional strength to the composite material. The elastomeric material --typically rubber -- acts as a flexural extender and thereby provides a measure of resilience to the composite material. It is also quite acceptable to use flexible polyvinylchloride in place of rubber as the elastomeric material. The enhanced resilience lessens the chance of the composite block cracking or breaking due to extreme temperatures or due to high loads or impact forces.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">According to a second aspect of the present invention, the composite blocks are, paving blocks, and in this case the polyethylene is replaced by phenolic resin.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0030" num="0030">In addition, the present invention provides a process for manufacturing blocks a process for manufacturing composite blocks, comprising placing asphalt and polyethylene, or phenolic resin where the block is a paving block, according to the features of claims 6,7,9 and 10.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Further the invention provides a construction material comprising asphalt in a proportion of about 25% to about 55% by volume, polyethylene in a proportion of about 10% to about 40% by volume monofilament fibre material in a proportion of about 5% to about 35% by volume; and elastomeric material in a proportion of about 5% to above 30% by volume.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0032" num="0032">In one embodiment of the invention, the composite material is entered into the heating oven in separate portions of a pre-determined weight. The portions are separated to the correct weight of a paving block of desired site by a computer controlled batch dispensing system.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">In another embodiment the composite material is entered into the heating oven as a continuous ribbon of material. Upon exiting the oven, the material is pre-plasticized and extruded and is then cut into portions of precise volume. These portions of composite material are then deposited to the molding system.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">An embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of a first process used to produce the molded paving block of the present invention;</li><li>Figure 2 is a schematic diagram of a second process used to produce the molded paving block of the present invention; and</li><li>Figure 3 is a partially cutaway view of the molded paving block of the present invention.</li></ul></p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Reference will now be made to Figure 1 which provides a schematic representation of a first preferred process used to form the composite paving block of the present invention. At the start of a production line 20, there is a blending drum 22. The various materials that are the components of the resulting composite material are entered into the blending drum 22, generally one at a time. In the preferred process, the blending drum 22 contains a mixture of asphalt, plastic, monofilament fibre material and elastomeric material. This mixture is blended in the rotating blending drum 22 until the various component materials are suitably blended together, as will be described in more detail subsequently.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The asphalt is preferably reclaimed asphalt that has been crushed and subsequently screened such the that the pieces are of a size of -4 mesh. The mesh measurement used is an industry<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> standard Tyler mesh. The term -4 mesh refers to fragmented or particulate material having a particle size of less than a 4 mesh.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The plastic is preferably recycled crushed plastic and should be of a size of -30 mesh. The plastic material is polyethylene or Phenolic resin. It is common to reclaim several types of plastic through recycling programs, with polyethylene. Inclusion of these other types of plastics in a small amount is not detrimental to the properties of the resulting end material that ultimately forms the paving block. Unexpectedly, it has been found that inclusion of other types of plastics in fairly large proportions -- even as much as 90% of the entire plastic content, with the rest being polyethylene -- has produced an acceptable resulting end material. Tests have shown that paving blocks made of such material merely have a lower strength, but in general retain a similar structural integrity to those blocks containing virtually 100% polyethylene as the plastic material.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The monofilament fibre material is preferably reclaimed monofilament fibre material that has been reclaimed from sources such as scrap tyres and is typically recovered from the tyres by a cryogenic process. Preferably, the material is chosen from the group of rayon, nylon, and similar polyesters. Further, the monofilament fibre material should have a strand length preferably between 1/8"(approx 3,2mm) and 3,8"(approx 9.5mm) with the ideal strand length being around 1/4"(approx 6,4mm). The monofilament strands recovered from scrap tires may be cut to this length by use of a suitable grinder. The monofilament fibre material is blown into the blending drum when the other component materials, or at least most of the other component materials, are in the blending drum 22 and while the blending drum 22 is rotating in order to achieve proper dispersion.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The elastomeric material is preferably reclaimed rubber that has been reclaimed from sources such as scrap tires. The preferred process for producing such reclaimed rubber is a cryogenic process, which is well known in the industry. The rubber that is produced by a suitable cryogenic process or a suitable ambient reduction<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> process, is preferably crumb rubber that is free from other materials found in the tires. The particles of crumb rubber should be of a size of -12 mesh. It is also quite acceptable to use flexible polyvinylchloride as the elastomeric material.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">These materials are entered into the blending drum 22 through a receiving hatch 24. The asphalt, polyethylene, and elastomeric material can be deposited separately from one another, or all together, as is convenient. It is preferable, as stated previously, to have the monofilament fibre material blown into the blending drum. It is important that the materials be in certain proportions within the blending drum 22. The preferred proportions are about 40% asphalt, about 25% plastic, about 20% monofilament fibre material and about 15% elastomeric material. These percentages are all expressed in terms of percent by volume. An acceptable range for each of these materials is from about 25% to about 55% asphalt, from about 10% to about 40% plastic, from about 5% to about 35% monofilament fibre material and from about 5% to about 30% elastomeric material. The percentages of course add up to 100%.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">After all of the materials have been placed in the blending drum 22, the blending drum 22 is rotated in order to blend the materials together into a uniformly distributed mixture. The blending drum 22 is heated in order to drive off excess moisture in the plastic, asphalt and the elastomeric material. It has been found that a temperature of about 130°F(approx 55°C)is useful in providing the proper heat for causing the excess moisture to be vapourized. It is useful in terms of energy efficiency to have water removed at this stage so that it will not absorb heat energy in a subsequent heating stage. Some fluidizing of the mixture occurs, but the mixture does not reach complete fluidity. The drum 22 must be rotated at a speed of between 10 r.p.m. and 35 r.p.m. in order to blend the materials properly such that they are evenly dispersed throughout the mixture. It has been found that the blending drum 22 should not be rotated faster than 35 r.p.m. because the drum 22 then acts as a centrifuge and causes the materials to separate, or at least to not blend properly, due to centrifugal force.<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --></p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The mixture is thoroughly blended in the blending drum 22, so that the materials become evenly dispersed to form a composite material that will be properly stabilized -- with respect to chemistry and dimensions -- when a paving block is ultimately formed. The composite material is removed from the heated blending drum through a discharge port 26, and is fed by gravity into a heated holding drum 30 through a receiving hatch 32. The heated blending drum 22 is stopped so that the material can be removed. Alternatively, it is possible to use a continuous extractor, such as a screw feed type extractor, to remove the composite material from the blending drum 22 through an opening in the end thereof, while the blending drum 22 is either stopped or rotating.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The holding drum 30 preferably rotates during the processing operation in order to keep the various components in the composite material from separating. The preferred rotational speed of the holding drum 30 is generally in the same speed range as the blending drum 22, or in a slightly slower speed range, below 10 r.p.m.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The composite material is removed from the holding drum 30 generally on a continuous basis, either as the holding drum 30 is rotating or when it is stopped. The holding drum 30 acts as a physical buffer for the composite material so that a generally continuous supply of the composite material can be provided to the remainder of the system. The overall process described herein will of course work without the holding drum 30, but the output in terms of number of blocks per unit time will not be maximized.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">From the holding drum 30, the composite material is metered through a discharge port 26 into a receiving hopper 34 of a computer controlled batch dispensing system. The batch dispensing system continuously measures the amount of the composite material in the receiving hopper 34. When the proper amount of material for forming one moulded paving block has been received by the receiving hopper 34 the material is removed from the receiving hopper as a discrete portion of composite material 36, and is<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> deposited into a continuous feed heating oven 40. The continuous feed oven 40 is shown in ghost outline so that the components therein may be more clearly seen.</p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The portions of composite material 36 are deposited on a PTFE coated steel belt 42 in the continuous feed oven 40. It is preferable that the portions of composite material 36 deposited on the PTFE coated steel belt 42 be about one-half inch thick so that subsequent heating of the portions of material 36 can take place rapidly. In order to accomplish this, the portions of composite material 36 are leveled to the desired height of 1/2"(approx 12,7mm) by a bridge as they enter the continuous feed oven 40.</p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The subsequent heating of the portions of composite material 36 occurs in the following manner. Within the continuous feed oven 40, there is a first series 44 of gas fired radiant heaters 48 located above the portion of the PTFE coated steel belt 42 that carries the portions of material 36 through the oven 40. This first series 44 of heaters 48 directly heats the mixture from above. There is also a second series 46 of heaters 48 below the lower portion of the PTFE coated steel belt 42. This second series of heaters 48 heat the portions of composite material 36 through the two layers of steel belt 42. The heaters in both the first series 44 and second series 46 of heaters 48 are preferably evenly spaced along the belt 42 with the number of heaters 48 being such that the heaters are placed close to one another so as to ensure even heating along the entire length of the belt 42.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">After each portion of composite material 36 has passed through the continuous feed oven 40, they reach an outlet opening 50 and are removed from the steel belt 42 preferably by a computer controlled plough 52. The plough 52 removes each portion of material 36 from the belt 42 and directs each portion of material 36 into a heated receiving hopper 54 of an automatic batch discharge system. The amount of material in each portion 36 is, of course, the desired amount for forming the resulting molded paving block.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The portion of composite material 36 is then dumped from the receiving hopper 54 into a molding system where it is molded into a<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> paving block. The molding system includes a mold 56, which in turn comprises a mold cavity 57 and mold plate 58. The mold cavity 57 receives the pardon of composite material 36 therein when it is in position 57A. The mold cavity 57 is then moved underneath the mold plate 58 to position 57B. The mold plate 58 is introduced to the mold cavity 57 by a hydraulic ram and a seal is formed between the two. The mold plate 58 directly contacts the portion of material 36 therein. A pressure of about 750p.s.i.(approx 51x10<sup>4</sup>kp/m<sup>2</sup>) applied in order that the material is formed properly into the desired shape of a molded paving block. The mold cavity 57 is then moved to position 57C where the molded paving block is discharged onto a water bath cooling conveyor 59, where they are quickly cooled for handling purposes. The resulting paving block has a compressive strength of about 7000p.s.i.(approx 48x10<sup>5</sup>kp/m<sup>2</sup>). As can be seen in Figure 3, the preferred shape of the paving block is a rectangular prism, with the preferred sites of these rectangular prism paving blocks being 200 mm long x 100 mm wide x 60 mm deep, and 200 mm long x 100 mm wide x 80 mm deep. With these rectangular prism paving blocks, a herringbone pattern can be created. A herringbone pattern has been found to be a preferable pattern for forming a road or other surface from rectangular prism blocks. Of course, virtually any suitable size block could be produced by the method disclosed herein.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Reference will now be made to Figure 2 which shows a second preferred process used to form the composite paving block of the present invention at production line 70. In this second preferred process, the composite material is discharged from the holding drum 30 in the form of a continuous ribbon of composite material. This continuous ribbon of composite material is deposited onto the travelling belt of the heating oven 40, wherein the composite material is allowed to temperature stabilize at a temperature of about 325°F(approx 163°C) to about 375°F(approx 191°C). The continuous ribbon of material is then discharged into an extruder 104 through an opening 106 in the top thereof. The composite material is extruded through a die 108 from the extruder 104 on a continuous basis. The extruded material is cut into slugs<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> 110 of a desired size by a computer controlled cutting blade 111. The extruder 104 is preferably a linear extruder (as shown) with the piston of the extruder 104 being driven by hydraulic power. The extruder may also be a screw extruder, as dictated by performance and cost considerations. The main reason for the extruder is to pre-plasticize the composite material and force any gases from the material, before the pressurization in the mold.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">The extruder is also preferably heated to the mixture at a temperature of about 325°F(approx 163°C) to about 375°F(approx 191°C) thereby allowing it to be more easily extruded. In any event, the extruder is preferably heated to keep the portion of composite material 36 at a proper temperature.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The slug 110 is then taken from the die 108 and placed into a mold 56 and is molded and subsequently cooled as described in the first preferred embodiment.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">The paving block of the present invention preferably has vertically oriented sides so that when the blocks are assembled together to form a road or other surface, they can be moved in a vertical direction into location one next to another. Assembly of a road or other surface from blocks with vertically oriented sides provides a surface wherein individual blocks can be removed and replaced generally independently one from another.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">The paving block of the present invention may also be of a shape other than the rectangular prism shape as disclosed in the preferred embodiment. In any event, the blocks are placed juxtaposed one to another in order to form a road or other surface. The blocks merely interfit one with another. They do not actually interlock as do the pieces of a typical jigsaw puzzle.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">In an alternative embodiment the continuous feed oven has in it a conveyor belt with a plurality of generally contiguously placed trays thereon, in place of the PTFE coated steel belt as described in the preferred embodiment. Segments of the composite material would be placed in each tray on the conveyor, and would be conveyed in the same manner through the oven.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --></p><p id="p0056" num="0056">It is also contemplated that the material of the present invention could be used more generally as a construction material to form entities such as preformed slabs for buildings and the like as defined by the appended claims.</p>

EP	0644972	B1	2000-08-16	fr	TITLE	1	SYSTEME DE FIXATION DE LATTES JUXTAPOSEES ET PARALLELES
EP	0644972	B1	2000-08-16	fr	DESCR	1	<p id="p0001" num="0001">La présente invention concerne un système de fixation pour assembler des lattes juxtaposées et parallèles, notamment en bois dont la surface supérieure est pré-vernie, en vue de revêtir une surface, comme par exemple un plancher ou un mur. Chaque latte possède un tenon et une mortaise, lesquels sont chacun disposés sur l'un de ses côtés longitudinaux. Lors de la pose, les lattes sont disposées de façon à ce que leur tenon emboîte la mortaise d'une latte adjacente.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">La méthode conventionnelle la plus utilisée pour installer un revêtement en bois consiste à fixer les planches directement au sous-plancher à l'aide de clous ou d'agrafes que l'on enfonce dans le sous-plancher avec des marteaux pneumatiques. Ces clous ou ces agrafes maintiennent solidement les lattes au sous-plancher mais produisent par leur passage à travers le bois, qui est relativement sec, de légères imperfections qui sont perceptibles à la surface des lattes. De plus, les clous et les agrafes font occasionnellement fendre le bois jusqu'à sa surface, les lattes ainsi endommagées devenant inutilisables.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">La méthode d'installation conventionnelle n'assure pas un alignement parfait des lattes sur le sous-plancher. Plusieurs facteurs peuvent en effet faire varier l'alignement des lattes les unes par rapport aux autres si, par exemple, une planche plus étroite que les autres est installée au milieu d'une rangée ou que l'une des lattes est arquée. Les lattes peuvent également présenter entre elles une légère déviation angulaire, ce qui produit des rangées arrondies, notamment perceptible si la surface est grande.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">La méthode de fixation conventionnelle génère des défauts qui rendent souvent le plancher inesthétique. De plus, il est très difficile d'enlever les lattes sans les<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> endommager et bien souvent, les lattes doivent être brisées pour être enlevées. Il n'est donc pas possible pour quelqu'un de faire poser un plancher de lattes et de le défaire lorsque cette personne déménage ou si le plancher n'est installé que sur une base temporaire, comme par exemple lors d'une exposition.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Les lattes des planchers posées de façon traditionnelle peuvent se pousser les unes sur les autres sous l'effet de l'humidité et ainsi créer des vides importants à certains endroits dus au retrait de l'humidité.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Lorsque le plancher est usé et qu'il doit être sablé et verni, il n'est pas possible de l'enlever pour faire ces opérations ailleurs; le sablage et le vernissage doivent être faits sur place avec tous les inconvénients que cela entraîne, tant pour les occupants que pour les ouvriers. Le sablage et le vernissage d'un plancher de bois dans une maison ou un édifice commercial contraignent souvent les occupants à quitter les lieux durant les travaux de réfection qui peuvent durer plusieurs jours. Durant ce temps, le sablage génère une poussière fine qui se répand partout et qui nécessitera un nettoyage de toute la maison ou de l'édifice. De plus, les machines utilisées pour effectuer le sablage peuvent endommager le plancher de façon permanente si elles ne sont pas bien utilisées, et donc nécessitent une main-d'oeuvre qualifiée. Quant aux vernis et autres produits de finition, la plupart dégagent des vapeurs de solvants nocives, parfois explosives, et des odeurs très fortes qui nuisent à la santé des ouvriers et qui contaminent l'air de la maison ou de l'édifice. Les délais de séchage et de durcissement du vernis allongent d'autant la période de non utilisation des pièces affectées.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Afin de résoudre les inconvénients du sablage et du vernissage des lattes sur le site même de leur utilisation, il existe sur le marché des lattes pré-vernies<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> et celles-ci peuvent être renvoyées à nouveau à l'usine lorsqu'elles sont usées afin d'être sablées et revernies. L'usine, avec des équipements appropriés, permet de faire toutes ces opérations sans affecter la santé des travailleurs. De plus, les vapeurs de solvants peuvent être filtrées.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Parmi les solutions proposées permettant d'enlever les lattes sans les endommager, on retrouve, par exemple, les systèmes décrits dans les brevets US-A-1 968 798, US-A-2 004 917, CA-A-898 480, CA-A-903 436, CA-A-965 569 et CA-A-1 165 088. Ces systèmes proposent des attaches, de diverses formes, coulissant dans des rails parallèles afin de maintenir en place les lattes transversales sans les endommager. Il faut que l'utilisateur enlève les attaches mobiles pour enlever les lattes de bois. Ces systèmes ne proposent rien quant à la synchronisation du positionnement des lattes ou de la pose d'un plancher par-dessus un revêtement existant sans endommager ce dernier.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Certains brevets, comme par exemple les brevets US-A-3 187 389, US-A-4 272 938, CA-A-405 366 et CA-A-571 352, proposent des agrafes individuelles maintenant en place les lattes sans les endommager. Ces agrafes ne permettent pas de résoudre le problème de synchronisation ou la pose d'un plancher par-dessus un revêtement existant sans endommager ce dernier. De plus, les agrafes peuvent se briser quand elles sont enlevées.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Le brevet US-A-1 988 201 présente un système dans lequel des plaques, pliées de façon à s'emboîter les unes aux autres, sont placées sous les lattes en les retenant. Toutefois, ce système requiert beaucoup de métal et ne résout pas le problème de la pose d'un plancher par-dessus un revêtement existant sans endommager ce dernier. De plus, les lattes doivent être usinées spécifiquement pour leur utilisation avec ce système.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Le brevet CA-A-579 973 présente un système dans lequel des languettes de métal ont des attaches réalisées par emboutissage, lesquelles emboîtent les jonctions entre les tenons et les mortaises des lattes. Les attaches doivent toutefois être pliées pour épouser la forme du tenon et de la mortaise, et donc, subir une déformation permanente. Ces attaches peuvent se casser lorsque les lattes sont enlevées et les languettes doivent donc être remplacées. De plus, ce système ne résout pas le problème de la pose d'un plancher par-dessus un revêtement existant sans endommager ce dernier.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Le document DE-A-41 10 749 décrit un système qui ressemble à celui du CA-A-579973 mentionné ci-dessus, mais qui propose une fixation aux mûrs et aux plafonds. Il n'est pas utilisable comme surface de parquet, puisqu'il n'est pas assez stable.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></p><p id="p0013" num="0013">La présente invention exposée dans les revendications 1 et 2 propose un système de fixation de lattes juxtaposées et parallèles permettant la pose synchronisée et la dépose de lattes, notamment des lattes de bois pré-vernies, sans les endommager et en leur assurant un alignement parfait. Elle propose également un système permettant la pose d'un plancher par-dessus un revêtement existant sans endommager ce dernier.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Le système de la présente invention a notamment l'avantage de pouvoir être utilisé avec des planches standards pouvant même être fixées de la façon traditionnelle en plus d'être réutilisable et de ne pas avoir besoin d'être enlevé en même temps que l'on enlève les lattes.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Un autre avantage de l'invention est de faciliter la pose du plancher afin qu'une personne ayant peu d'expérience dans le domaine et un minimum d'outillage puisse l'installer elle-même.<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><p id="p0016" num="0016">L'invention sera mieux comprise à la lecture non limitative qui suit d'un mode de réalisation préféré de l'invention faite en se référant aux dessins annexés dans lesquels:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>la figure 1 représente une vue du dessus d'une languette selon le premier mode de réalisation préféré de l'invention,</li><li>la figure 2 représente une vue de côté d'une languette retenant des lattes selon le premier mode de réalisation préféré de l'invention,</li><li>la figure 3 représente une vue d'élévation de la figure 2,</li><li>la figure 4 représente une vue du dessus des languettes retenant des lattes selon le premier mode de réalisation,<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></li><li>la figure 5 représente une vue du dessus d'une languette selon le deuxième mode de réalisation préféré de l'invention,</li><li>la figure 6 représente une vue du dessus d'une latte d'alignement,</li><li>la figure 7 représente une vue du dessus d'un support flexible,</li><li>la figure 8 représente une vue de côté d'une languette retenant des lattes selon un deuxième mode de réalisation préféré de l'invention,</li><li>la figure 9 représente une vue d'élévation de la figure 8,</li><li>la figure 10 représente une vue du dessus des languettes retenant des lattes selon le deuxième mode de réalisation préféré de l'invention.</li></ul></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Le système de fixation selon l'invention, illustré aux figures 1 à 10, comprend des languettes 10 faites en acier trempé et dans lesquelles sont embouties des appuis 12 projetant vers le haut. Les appuis 12 sont pourvus, à leur extrémité, de deux dents 14 en forme de pointe, repliées à 90° parallèlement à la surface des languettes 10 et projetant légèrement vers le haut. Les appuis 12 et les dents 14 sont formés par emboutissage. Leur but est d'empêcher les lattes 20 de se soulever en les retenant au sol.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Les lattes 20 comprennent une surface supérieure 22, une surface inférieure 24, deux extrémités 26 et 28 ainsi que deux côtés latéraux 30 et 32. Le côté latéral 30 comporte un tenon 36 s'étendant sensiblement sur toute la longueur longitudinale de la latte 20, et le côté latéral 32 comporte une mortaise 38 s'étendant sensiblement sur toute la longueur longitudinale de la latte 20. Les extrémités 26 et 28 comportent respectivement une mortaise 38 et 40. Des rainures longitudinales 46, pratiquées sur la surface<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> inférieure 24, permettent d'éviter que les lattes 20 s'arrondissent s'il survient un excédent d'humidité.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Les lattes 20 ont une surface supérieure 22 préférablement pré-vernie en usine de façon à ce qu'il n'y ait pas de vernissage à faire après la pose. Lorsque le plancher sera usé, ou si un changement de couleur est nécessaire, les lattes 20 peuvent être enlevées et retournées à l'usine pour effectuer les opérations nécessaires. Toutefois, le sablage et le vernissage peuvent s'effectuer sur place si nécessaire.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Les appuis 12 ont une hauteur égale à la distance entre la surface inférieure 24 des lattes 20 et le bas des mortaises 38. La distance entre les appuis 12 est égale à la largeur des lattes 20. Tel qu'illustré sur les figures 2 et 8, les dents 14, qui pointent légèrement vers le haut, viennent se placer juste sur la surface du bas des mortaises 38 et laissent quand même assez de place pour les tenons 36.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Lors du montage, les languettes 10 sont disposées parallèlement les unes par rapport aux autres sur la surface à revêtir 11. Les appuis 12 des languettes 10 doivent être alignées les unes avec les autres de façon à ce que les lattes 20, placées transversalement sur les languettes 10, puissent être posées. Chaque rangée de lattes 20 est montée l'une après l'autre et dans la direction où pointent les dents 14.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">D'abord, chaque latte 20 de la première rangée est installée de façon à ce que le bas de leur mortaise 38 s'insère contre l'appui 12 et sous les dents 14, tel qu'illustré sur les figures 2 et 8. Les lattes 20 d'une même rangée sont placées bout à bout et il n'est pas nécessaire qu'elles aient toutes la même longueur. Les lattes 20 sont ensuite rabaissées contre le sol de façon à ce que leur tenon 36 viennent reposer librement sur la prochaine série d'appuis 12. Puisque chaque dent 14 pointe légèrement vers<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> le haut, leur pointe s'enfonce légèrement dans le tenon 36, permettant ainsi d'éviter qu'elles nuisent à l'insertion des lattes suivantes.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">La deuxième rangée de lattes 20 est installée contre la série d'appuis 12 sur lesquels reposent les tenons 36 de la première rangée. La partie du bas de leur mortaise 38 est insérée contre ces appuis 12 et sous leurs dents 14, emprisonnant ainsi les tenons 36 de la première rangée de lattes 20. La rangée de lattes 20 précédente se retrouve alors contrainte à l'immobilité. Les autres rangées se posent de la même façon jusqu'à ce que le plancher ait la largeur désirée. Il est à noter que les extrémités 26 et 28 des lattes 20 ne sont pas alignées avec celles des rangées adjacentes. Ceci rend le plancher plus esthétique et plus solide.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">La différence majeure entre les deux modes de réalisation préférés de l'invention est les moyens utilisés pour maintenir en place les languettes 10 les unes par rapport aux autres.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Selon le premier mode de réalisation préféré de l'invention, illustré aux figures 1 à 4, la surface à revêtir 11 est un sous-plancher dans lequel des vis peuvent être enfoncées. Les languettes 10 comportent des trous 42 dans lesquelles sont placées des vis 44 servant à fixer solidement les languettes 10 au sous-plancher 11. Ces vis 44 comportent chacune une tête 45 très plate qui vient se placer dans de légères dépressions autour des trous 42.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Puisque les languettes 10 n'ont pas toujours exactement la bonne longueur, il est parfois nécessaire de les couper afin de les raccourcir ou d'en faire de courts bouts pour rallonger une languette 10 trop courte. La coupe des languettes 10, selon le premier mode de réalisation, comporte des marques 48 servant de marque de coupe et permettant ainsi de conserver la synchronisation de la pose.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Le système de fixation tel que décrit dans ce premier mode de réalisation peut s'appliquer autant au recouvrement d'un plancher, qu'à celui d'un mur et même d'un plafond.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Selon le deuxième mode de réalisation préféré de l'invention, illustré aux figures 5 à 10, les languettes 10 ne sont pas vissées au sous-plancher 11, mais plutôt maintenues en place les unes par rapport aux autres par le biais de lattes d'alignement 70 placées perpendiculairement aux languettes 10. Quant aux languettes 10, elles reposent sur les supports flexibles 80, faits en caoutchouc, ou autre matériau semblable, s'étendant sur toute leur longueur. Le système de fixation n'est maintenu en place sur la surface à revêtir que par gravité, ce qui permet de l'installer directement sur un revêtement existant sans l'endommager. Il est même possible de l'installer sur du tapis s'il n'est pas possible, ou permis, d'enlever ce dernier.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">La pose d'un plancher maintenu en place par gravité est notamment très utile pour les appartements ou les expositions temporaires, soit là où le locataire n'a pas le droit d'endommager le plancher existant et où il désire l'emporter lorsqu'il déménage afin de le réutiliser ailleurs.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Dans le deuxième mode de réalisation préféré, les languettes 10 comportent des parois latérales 90 projetant vers le bas et s'étendant sur toute leur longueur. Les parois 90 servent à prendre les supports flexibles 80 en étau. Le bas des parois 90 repose sur les côtés 82 de la base des supports flexibles 80, tel qu'illustré sur la figure 9. Des renflements 92, placés à l'intérieur des parois 90, permettent de serrer davantage les supports flexibles 80 afin de les maintenir plus efficacement. À cet effet, les parois latérales des supports flexibles 80 ont des rainures longitudinales 84 servant à recevoir et à<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> bloquer les renflements 92.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Les parois latérales 90 ont des ouvertures 94, régulièrement espacées, qui permettent de faire passer les lattes d'alignement 70 transversalement. La largeur des ouvertures 94 est plus petite que la largeur des lattes d'alignement 70, mais ces dernières sont pourvues d'encoches 72, régulièrement espacées, placées deux par deux sur leurs côtés tel qu'illustré à la figure 6. La distance entre les encoches 72 d'une même arête latérale est égale à la largeur des languettes 10. Les lattes d'alignement 70 peuvent être facilement raccourcies grâce aux marques 74 servant de marque de coupe, permettant ainsi de conserver la synchronisation de la pose, les lattes d'alignement 70 étant aboutées au niveau des languettes 10.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Pour poser ce système de fixation, on place tout d'abord les supports flexibles 80, puis, perpendiculairement, les lattes d'alignement 70 vis-à-vis où vont être les ouvertures 94. Ensuite, lorsque le tout est bien aligné, on place les languettes 10 par-dessus les supports flexibles 80 et en emboîtant au passage les lattes d'alignement 70. Les languettes 10 doivent être placées de façon à ce que leurs dents 14 soient toutes dans la même direction.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Tel qu'illustré à la figure 10, la pose des lattes 20 se fait de la même façon que dans le premier mode de réalisation.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Les lattes 20 de la dernière rangée posée doivent être fixées par un moyen auxiliaire afin de les empêcher de se soulever. Si les dernières lattes 20 s'étendent légèrement dans le mur, ceci peut être fait, par exemple, à l'aide de quart de rond de finition placés par-dessus celles-ci. D'autres méthodes sont aussi possibles.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Le système de fixation des lattes décrit précédemment est très efficace pour corriger les lattes 20<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> qui sont arquées car elles sont maintenues droites dans les appuis 12 qui forment un étau individuel. Ceci permet de retenir les lattes 20 en contact plus étroit entre elles en limitant le travail dû à l'humidité. De plus, les lattes 20 ne viennent plus en contact direct avec le sous-plancher, souvent beaucoup plus humide que les lattes 20, puisqu'elles reposent sur les languettes 10. Il empêche ainsi les lattes qui gonfleraient, à cause d'un surplus d'humidité, d'empiéter sur l'espace occupé par les lattes adjacentes, limitant ainsi la possibilité de vide entre les lattes à cause d'une diminution de l'humidité par la suite.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Puisqu'aucun clou ne traverse les lattes 20, les probabilités de craquement seront très réduites lorsque des gens marcheront sur celles-ci. En effet, l'absence de fissures importantes causées par les clous lors de la pose traditionnelle évite que deux parties d'une même latte 20 viennent se frotter ensemble et causent du bruit. La présente invention, gardant les lattes 20 intactes, permet de solutionner ce problème.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Enfin, il est possible de créer un plancher avec divers motifs en alternant des sections perpendiculaires l'une à l'autre. Il est également possible de créer des languettes 10 dont les appuis 12 sont à angle ou bien parallèles à leur axe longitudinal afin de répondre à certains critères de design.</p>

EP	0619773	B1	2000-03-15	fr	DESCR	1	<p id="p0001" num="0001">L'invention concerne un procédé et un dispositif de fabrication de blocs de construction par moulage sous pression élevée d'un mélange d'un liant hydraulique tel que du plâtre, d'une charge inerte telle que du sable et d'eau.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Ces blocs de construction et leur procédé de fabrication ont été décrits dans la Demande Internationale WO 88/03916 du même inventeur.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Ce procédé consiste à mouler sous pression élevée le mélange de plâtre, de sable et d'eau pendant une durée suffisante, de l'ordre de 2 à 3 mn, correspondant à l'hydratation sous pression du plâtre qui se traduit par une expansion contrariée du plâtre à l'intérieur du moule, ainsi que par une densification et une réorientation de son réseau cristallin.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Les blocs de construction ainsi obtenus ont des caractéristiques remarquables : une résistance à la compression largement supérieure à 100 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>, une dureté équivalente à celle de la pierre tendre, une bonne résistance à l'humidité et au gel, et une précision dimensionnelle de l'ordre du 1/10<sup>e</sup> de millimètre, ce qui permet de les monter directement les uns sur les autres sans interposition de joints traditionnels entre les blocs.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Ces blocs sont de plus utilisables en construction à leur sortie des moules, sans séchage.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Il en résulte une économie de construction considérable, aussi bien en temps qu'en qualification de main d'oeuvre, les frais de construction proprement dits étant divisés par un facteur au moins égal à 2 ou 3.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">La demande internationale WO 88/03916 précitée décrit également un dispositif de fabrication de ces blocs, comprenant les moyens décrits dans le préambule de la revendication 4 et dans lequel la presse hydraulique est utilisée pour maintenir les plateaux du moule en<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> place pendant l'hydratation du plâtre et pour résister à l'expansion volumique du plâtre, ce qui amène à laisser le moule dans la presse pendant 2 à 3 minutes environ et ne permet pas une cadence élevée de fabrication des blocs.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">La présente invention a pour objet des perfectionnements importants au procédé et au dispositif précités, qui permettent d'améliorer encore les caractéristiques des blocs de construction précités, d'uniformiser leur qualité et de réduire leur prix de revient.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Elle a également pour objet des moyens permettant de fabriquer ces blocs en grande quantité et à cadence élevée.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">L'invention propose à cet effet un procédé de fabrication de blocs de construction à partir d'un mélange d'un liant hydraulique tel que du plâtre, d'une charge inerte telle que du sable et d'eau, le liant hydraulique augmentant de volume au cours de son hydratation et le mélange précité étant moulé sous pression pendant une durée suffisante pour obtenir une hydratation sous pression du liant hydraulique et une densification de son réseau cristallin, le procédé consistant à placer une quantité dosée du mélange dans un moule à parois latérales indéformables et à plateaux horizontaux supérieur et inférieur déplaçables en translation verticale dans le moule avec un jeu faible par rapport au parois latérales, caractérisé en ce qu'il consiste ensuite à déplacer lentement au moins l'un des plateaux vers l'intérieur du moule sur des courses successives prédeterminées pour tasser le mélange à l'intérieur du moule, puis pour donner une hauteur prédéfinie au bloc à obtenir en comprimant progressivement le mélange dans le moule, à maintenir en place lesdits plateaux pendant la durée précitée d'hydratation du liant hydraulique en résistant à son<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> expansion volumique et ensuite à écarter l'un des plateaux pour démouler le bloc par déplacement de l'autre plateau vers l'intérieur du moule.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">La compression lente du mélange placé dans le moule a pour effet, successivement, de tasser le mélange dans le moule en réduisant son foisonnement, de chasser l'air contenu dans le mélange et d'accélérer le mouillage du mélange grâce à la mise en pression de l'eau, de chasser hors du moule un éventuel excès d'eau par rapport à la quantité d'eau juste nécessaire à l'hydratation du plâtre, et de définir avec précision la hauteur (ou dimension encre les plateaux horizontaux du moule) du bloc de construction à obtenir. Le maintien en place des plateaux du moule, dans la position qu'ils occupent à la fin de la phase de compression, permet de conserver cette hauteur pendant la phase suivante, qui est une phase d'hydratation sous pression et d'expansion contrariée du plâtre dans le moule.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Les blocs de construction ainsi produits ont des dimensions bien définies et une résistance à la compression qui est au moins égale à une valeur prédéterminée.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Selon une autre caractéristique de l'invention, ce procédé consiste également à détecter l'augmentation de pression dans le moule résultant de l'expansion contrariée du liant hydraulique, pour définir la fin de la durée d'expansion contrariée dans le moule et démouler le bloc de construction, lorsque cette pression a atteint une valeur prédéterminée.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">De préférence, cette valeur prédéterminée de la pression dans le moule ne correspondra qu'à 70-90% environ de l'hydratation complète du liant hydraulique dans le moule, de façon à réduire l'effort à fournir pour le démoulage des blocs de construction et l'usure des moules.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">L'invention propose également un dispositif pour l'exécution de ce procédé, comprenant un moule à parois verticales indéformables et à plateaux horizontaux supérieur et inférieur, qui sont déplaçables en translation dans le moule avec un jeu faible par rapport aux parois verticales, des moyens de positionnement du plateau inférieur dans le moule, des moyens de remplissage du moule par une quantité dosée du mélange précité, des moyens de mise en place du plateau supérieur dans le moule, au moins une presse hydraulique pour déplacer au moins l'un des plateaux à l'intérieur du moule pour tasser le mélange dans le moule et le comprimer sous pression élevée jusqu'à la hauteur désirée du bloc à obtenir, des moyens de retrait d'au moins un des plateaux du moule, et des moyens de démoulage à vérin hydraulique pour sortir le bloc du moule, caractérisé en ce que la presse est commandée pour déplacer lentement le ou les plateaux précités à l'intérieur du moule sur des courses successives prédéterminées de tassement et de compression et en ce que le dispositif comprend des moyens indépendants de la presse pour maintenir en place les plateaux dans le moule pendant l'expansion du liant hydraulique résultant de son hydratation.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Par ailleurs, le dispositif peut également comprendre des moyens de détection de l'augmentation de pression du mélange dans le moule, résultant de l'expansion contrariée du liant hydraulique.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">De préférence, au moins le plateau supérieur du moule comprend un rebord oblique sur au moins une partie de la périphérie de sa face de contact avec le mélange dans le moule, pour former un chanfrein (continu ou discontinu) sur au moins une partie du bord périphérique supérieur du bloc de construction.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">La présence de ce chanfrein évite les risques de fissuration ou d'éclatement du bord périphérique supérieur du bloc de construction, lorsque les plateaux du<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> moule sont libérés à la fin de la phase d'expansion contrariée, avant le démoulage.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Par ailleurs, en prévoyant un chanfrein identique sur le bord périphérique inférieur du bloc de<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> construction, on améliore l'aspect d'une construction formée par la pose de ces blocs les uns sur les autres.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Selon une autre caractéristique de l'invention, la presse hydraulique comprend des plateaux supérieur et inférieur entre lesquels est placé le moule et qui sont reliés par une transmission mécanique propre à définir de façon positive une distance déterminée entre les plateaux de la presse, correspondant à la hauteur désirée du bloc de construction, et à assurer le parallélisme de ces plateaux.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">On évite ainsi d'utiliser des butées mécaniques sur lesquels les plateaux de la presse viendraient en appui, et l'on peut mesurer les efforts de tension ou de compression auxquels sont soumis des éléments de cette transmission mécanique lors de la phase d'expansion contrariée du liant hydraulique dans le moule, pour définir la fin de cette phase d'expansion contrariée.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">De façon générale, l'invention permet d'automatiser de façon fiable et sûre le procédé de fabrication des blocs de construction, d'améliorer et d'uniformiser leur qualité, et d'augmenter très sensiblement leur cadence de fabrication.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">L'invention sera mieux comprise et d'autres caractéristiques, détails et avantages de celle-ci apparaitront plus clairement à la lecture de la description qui suit, faite à titre d'exemple en référence aux dessins annexés, dans lesquels :<ul id="ul0001" list-style="dash" compact="compact"><li>les figures 1, 2 et 3 sont des vues schématiques de dessus, en coupe verticale et de dessous respectivement, d'un bloc de construction selon l'invention;</li><li>la figure 4 est

8.</li></ul></p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Le bloc de construction qui a été représenté dans les figures 1 à 3 est sensiblement identique à celui qui a été décrit dans la Demande Internationale WO 88/03916 et est de tonne parallépipédique rectangle, avec des dimensions qui sont par exemple de 15cm x 15cm x 30 cm. Un bloc selon l'invention, ayant ces dimensions, pèse un peu plus d'une dizaine de kilos et est facilement manipulable à la main. Bien entendu, l'invention permet également la fabrication de blocs ayant des formes et dimensions différentes.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">La face supérieure 12 de ce bloc comporte des saillies 14 de faible hauteur, de forme carrée ou circulaire par exemple.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">La face inférieure 16 du bloc comprend une cavité 18 d'un volume relativement important (de l'ordre de 30% du volume total par exemple), qui s'étend sur une certaine hauteur à l'intérieur du bloc 10 et dont le débouché sur la face inférieure 16 du bloc est délimité par des bords longitudinaux 20 et transversaux 22 qui définissent des logements des saillies 14 de la face supérieure d'un autre bloc.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">En outre, la face inférieure 16 du bloc comporte une rainure ou un canal longitudinal 24 s'étendant sur toute sa longueur, qui communique avec la cavité 18 et qui débouche à l'une des ses extrémités longitudinales dans une rainure verticale 26 formée sur toute la hauteur du bloc, dans une de ses faces verticales d'extrémité.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0028" num="0028">Comme cela est expliqué dans la Demande Internationale précitée, les blocs 10 sont destinés à être posés les uns sur les autres et les uns à côté des autres, en étant tous orientés dans le même sens, pour former un mur comprenant des rangées horizontales de blocs dans lesquels les blocs sont décalés entre eux d'une demi-longueur d'une rangée à l'autre. Du plâtre relativement liquide est versé en deux fois dans les rainures verticales 26 pour venir remplir partiellement les cavités 18 des blocs en recouvrant les saillies 14 des faces supérieures des blocs inférieurs, puis pour remplir les rainures verticales 26.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Comme on le voit sur les figures 1 à 3, un chanfrein 28 est formé sur au moins une partie des bords périphériques des faces supérieure et inférieure du bloc de construction. Des chanfreins identiques peuvent aussi être formés sur les bords verticaux du bloc.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Les figures 4 et 5 représentent schématiquement un moule utilisé pour la fabrication du bloc représenté dans les figures 1 à 3.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Ce moule comprend quatre parois verticales 30 en acier, qui sont assemblées rigidement entre elles, de préférence par des boulons 32 et qui sont positionnées les unes par rapport aux autres au moyen de pions de centrage 34 pour définir de façon précise la longueur et la largeur de la cavité de moulage, avec une tolérance dimensionnelle de l'ordre de quelques centièmes de millimètre. Les faces intérieures des parois verticales 30 sont rectifiées pour être parfaitement lisses et planes. L'une des parois verticales 30, formant une des petites faces verticales d'extrémité du moule, comporte sur toute sa hauteur une saillie verticale 36 de forme semi-cylindrique destinée à former la rainure verticale 26 du bloc de construction à obtenir.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Les parois verticales 30 du moule ont une hauteur supérieure à celle du bloc à obtenir, de façon à recevoir<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> entre elles le plateau supérieur 38 et le plateau inférieur 40 du moule. Lorsque la hauteur du bloc à obtenir est de 15 cm, les parois verticales 30 du moule auront une hauteur comprise entre 25 et 30 cm environ.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Les plateaux du moule sont des plaques rectangulaires en acier, dimensionnées pour pouvoir être déplaçables par translation verticale à l'intérieur du moule, avec un jeu faible de quelques dixièmes de millimètres par rapport aux parois verticales. Par ailleurs, les faces internes des parois verticales 30 forment avec la verticale un angle de dépouille faible de l'ordre de 0,5° pour faciliter le démoulage du bloc de construction.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">La face inférieure du plateau supérieur 38 du moule comporte deux petites cavités 42, dont les formes correspondent à celles des saillies 14 de la face supérieure du bloc de construction à obtenir, et un rebord périphérique oblique 44 de formation du chanfrein 28 du bloc à obtenir. Ce rebord oblique peut être prévu uniquement sur une partie de la périphérie de la face inférieure du plateau 38. Une petite face verticale du plateau 38 comporte une rainure semi-cylindrique correspondant à la saillie verticale 36.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">La face supérieure du plateau inférieur 40 porte un noyau 46 destiné à former la cavité 18 et le canal longitudinal 24 dans la face inférieure du bloc à obtenir. De plus, une petite face verticale de ce plateau 40 et du noyau 46 comporte une rainure verticale semi-cylindrique, destinée à recevoir la saillie verticale 36 de la paroi latérale 30 correspondante du moule. Le bord supérieur du plateau 40 comporte également un rebord périphérique oblique de formation du chanfrein 28 précité du bloc de construction. Comme précédemment, ce rebord oblique peut être prévu uniquement sur une partie de la périphérie du plateau 40.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Dans une variante de réalisation de ce moule, au moins l'une des grandes parois verticales 30 du moule<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> est fixée de façon facilement amovible aux autres parois par tout moyen approprié, comprenant par exemple des charnières et/ou des leviers de verrouillage. Le retrait de cette grande paroi 30 du moule peut faciliter le démoulage du bloc de construction. De plus, cette paroi 30 peut être destinée à recevoir sur sa face interne une plaque d'une matière quelconque appropriée destinée à former un parement de façade sur le bloc de construction.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">Les différents postes d'un dispositif de fabrication d'un bloc de construction selon l'invention ont été représentés schématiquement en figure 6.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Dans cette figure, le dessin du moule 50 a été simplifié, mais il est bien entendu que ce moule peut être identique à celui représenté schématiquement dans les figures 4 et 5.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Le premier poste du dispositif selon l'invention, désigné généralement par la référence A, est un poste de remplissage du moule 50. A ce poste, le moule 50 repose sur une surface de support 52, qui peut faire partie de moyens de transfert des moules entre les différents postes du dispositif de fabrication. Le plateau inférieur 40 du moule est également porté par cette surface de support 52, de façon à occuper une position définie à l'intérieur du moule. Des moyens 54 permettent de déverser à l'intérieur du moule une quantité dosée d'un mélange 56 d'un liant hydraulique tel que du plâtre, d'une charge inerte telle que du sable, et d'eau. Les moyens 54 d'amenée de ce mélange sont avantageusement conçus pour réaliser également l'humidification d'un mélange sec de plâtre et de sable avec une quantité d'eau qui sera sensiblement égale ou légèrement supérieure à la quantité d'eau nécessaire à la compacité optimale du mélange (cette quantité d'eau étant supérieure à celle nécessaire à l'hydratation du plâtre).</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Pour la fabrication d'un bloc de construction tel que représenté aux figures 1 à 3, et ayant des dimensions<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> de 15cm x 15 cm x 30 cm, on utilise un mélange comprenant environ 6 kg de sable, 4 kg de plâtre et 1,3-1,5 litres d'eau selon les granulométries du sable et du plâtre. Ce mélange est déversé dans le moule en quelques secondes.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Le moule est ensuite transféré au poste suivant, désigné par la référence B, où le plateau supérieur 38 du moule est placé dans le moule et repose sur le mélange 56 de plâtre, de sable et d'eau.</p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Eventuellement, l'un ou l'autre des postes A et B ou les deux postes, peuvent comprendre une table vibrante permettant de réaliser un début de tassement du mélange 56 dans le moule, une évacuation de l'air occlus et un meilleur mouillage.</p><p id="p0043" num="0043">Le poste suivant, désigné par la référence C, comporte essentiellement une presse hydraulique à deux plateaux horizontaux mobiles 58 et 60 entre lesquels est placé le moule 50. Un ou plusieurs vérins hydrauliques 62 permettent de déplacer les plateaux de la presse, par exemple en synchronisme, dans des directions opposées pour les rapprocher et pour les écarter l'un de l'autre. Par exemple, les tiges de piston des vérins 62 s'appuient sur le plateau supérieur 58 de la presse tandis que leurs cylindres sont portés par une plaque horizontale 64 déplaçable en translation verticale et reliée par des tirants 66 au plateau inférieur 60 de la presse.</p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Les tirants 66 permettent d'assurer l'obtention et le maintien de la distance voulue entre les plateaux du moule, et sont le siège d'efforts de tension que l'on peut mesurer pour contrôler la bonne exécution du procédé.</p><p id="p0045" num="0045">Le plateau supérieur 58 de la presse s'applique sur le plateau supérieur 38 du moule tandis que les parois verticales 30 et le plateau inférieur 40 du moule s'appuient sur le plateau inférieur 60 de la presse.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0046" num="0046">La compression du mélange 56 dans le moule est réalisée de façon lente, de préférence en deux temps :<ul id="ul0002" list-style="dash" compact="compact"><li>une premier temps au cours duquel le mélange 56 est simplement tassé dans le moule par descente du plateau supérieur 38 à l'intérieur du moule, sur une course de plusieurs centimètres (de 4 à 10 cm par exemple), la durée de cette course étant de plusieurs secondes (par exemple de 5 à 10 s environ);</li><li>un deuxième temps au cours duquel le plateau supérieur 38 est enfoncé dans le moule sur une course de plusieurs centimètres jusqu'à ce que la distance séparant les plateaux 38 et 40 du moule soit égale à la hauteur désirée du bloc de construction. La durée de ce deuxième temps est de plusieurs secondes et la pression appliquée au mélange 56 à l'intérieur du moule atteint des valeurs comprises entre 50 et 100 kg/cm<sup>2</sup> environ, selon les cas.</li></ul></p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Ces deux temps de compression peuvent être réalisés soit par déplacement d'un des deux plateaux 38, 40 à l'intérieur du moule, soit par déplacement des deux plateaux 38,40 l'un vers l'autre.</p><p id="p0048" num="0048">Au cours de la compression du mélange 56 dans le moule, l'air contenu dans ce mélange est chassé par le jeu entre les parois verticales et les plateaux du moule, l'eau se répartit uniformément dans le mélange de plâtre et de sable grâce à la pression exercée, et un éventuel excès d'eau est chassé par le jeu entre les parois verticales et les plateaux du moule. La distance entre les plateaux 38 et 40 du moule, correspondant à la hauteur désirée du bloc à obtenir, est de préférence définie de façon positive par une transmission mécanique reliant entre eux les plateaux 58 et 60 de la presse et assurant leur parallélisme.</p><p id="p0049" num="0049">Lorsque les plateaux 38 et 40 du moule ont été amenés à la distance voulue correspondant à la hauteur du bloc à obtenir, ils sont immobilisés. La pression dans le moule va alors chuter sensiblement pendant un laps de<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> temps bref, puis va augmenter progressivement au fur et à mesure de l'expansion du plâtre, résultant de son hydratation.</p><p id="p0050" num="0050">En conséquence, lorsque les plateaux 38 et 40 du moule ont été amenés à la distance voulue l'un de l'autre par les vérins hydrauliques 62 de la presse, ces vérins sont à nouveau commandés pour écarter les plateaux 58 et 60 et permettre le transfert du moule 50 au poste suivant, désigné par la référence D, où les plateaux 38 et 40 du moule sont maintenus dans une position correspondant à la hauteur désirée du bloc à obtenir. Pour cela, le poste D peut comprendre par exemple des moyens 68 de support du moule et du plateau inférieur 40, et des moyens d'appui sur le plateau supérieur 38, ces moyens pouvant être du type mécanique, par exemple des leviers 70 montés à rotation sur un support 72, et/ou du type hydraulique, par exemple des vérins 74 portés par le support 72.</p><p id="p0051" num="0051">Le moule 50 est maintenu au poste D pendant une durée suffisante pour que l'hydratation du plâtre se produise à 70-90% environ à l'intérieur du moule 50. Cette durée peut varier de 1,5 à 5 mn environ, en fonction de la température, du type et de la quantité de plâtre utilisé, et du degré d'hydratation du plâtre que l'on veut obtenir sous pression. L'augmentation de pression dans le moule 50, qui résulte de l'expansion contrariée du plâtre, peut être très importante et atteindre des valeurs de l'ordre de 100 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p0052" num="0052">Les moyens d'appui 70, 74 vont donc avoir une résistance suffisante pour s'opposer à la pression exercée sur le plateau supérieur 38 du moule.</p><p id="p0053" num="0053">De préférence, la pression à l'intérieur du moule est détectée par des moyens appropriés, de façon à ce que les moyens d'appui 70, 74 libèrent le plateau supérieur 38 du moule dès que cette pression a atteint une valeur prédéterminée. On peut, pour cela, mesurer par<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> exemple la pression à l'intérieur des vérins hydrauliques 74 et mettre ces vérins à l'échappement dès que la pression atteint une valeur prédéterminée, ou bien mesurer l'effort exercé sur les leviers 70 et les faire pivoter pour libérer le plateau 38 quand cet effort atteint une valeur déterminée. On peut également mesurer la tension de biellettes reliant les supports 68 et 72 et commander la libération du plateau supérieur 38 dès que cette tension atteint une valeur prédéterminée.</p><p id="p0054" num="0054">On peut également équiper les vérins hydrauliques 74 d'un limiteur de pression, de façon à ce que la pression à l'intérieur du moule 50 ne puisse dépasser une valeur prédéterminée.</p><p id="p0055" num="0055">A titre d'exemple, on a représenté schématiquement au poste D un moyen 76 de mesure de la pression dans un vérin 74, ce moyen 76 étant associé à un moyen 78 de commande du vérin.</p><p id="p0056" num="0056">A l'issue de cette phase d'expansion contrariée du plâtre dans le moule 50, les moyens 70, 74 d'appui sur le plateau supérieur 38 du moule sont écartés et le moule est transféré au poste suivant désigné par la référence E, où le plateau supérieur 38 du moule est retiré.</p><p id="p0057" num="0057">Le moule est ensuite transféré au poste suivant, désigné par la référence F et qui est un poste de démoulage.</p><p id="p0058" num="0058">A ce poste, les parois verticales 30 du moule sont immobilisées entre des butées, et un ou plusieurs vérins hydrauliques 80 exercent un effort important sur le plateau inférieur 40, pour le pousser vers le haut et permettre l'extraction du bloc 82 par des moyens 84 de prise et de transfert, le bloc 82 étant manipulable et utilisable dès sa sortie du moule. Au début du démoulage, l'effort fourni par le ou les vérins 80 peut être très important (par exemple de l'ordre de 100 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>) sur une faible course, après quoi la dépouille verticale des<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> faces 30 facilite le déplacement vers le haut du plateau inférieur 40.</p><p id="p0059" num="0059">Il faut ensuite redescendre (par exemple au moyen des vérins 80) le plateau inférieur 40 en position dans le moule, qui est alors transféré au poste A, pour être à nouveau rempli d'un mélange de plâtre, de sable et d'eau.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Le poste occupé le plus longtemps par les moules est le poste D où se produit l'expansion contrariée du plâtre pendant une durée comprise entre 1,5 et 5 mn environ. Le dispositif selon l'invention peut donc comprendre plusieurs de ces postes, agencés pour être déplaçables sur un trajet de longueur déterminée entre le poste C et le poste E, par exemple au moyen d'un carrousel comprenant une dizaine des postes D, tournant pas à pas entre le poste C et le poste E.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">L'ensemble du dispositif peut également se présenter sous forme d'un carrousel tournant entre les postes A, C et F, et comportant un certain nombre de postes D, ainsi que des moyens de pose et de retrait des couvercles supérieurs 38 des moules.</p><p id="p0062" num="0062">La cadence de fabrication n'est alors limitée que par la durée des opérations au poste C, qui est de l'ordre d'une quinzaine de secondes, et peut donc atteindre 200 blocs/heure environ.</p><p id="p0063" num="0063">On peut augmenter largement cette cadence en réalisant le premier temps de compression du mélange dans le moule au poste B, et le deuxième temps au poste C.</p><p id="p0064" num="0064">Si nécessaire, on peut, pour augmenter encore cette cadence, utiliser des moules à empreintes multiples, ce qui permet de multiplier la cadence de fabrication par le nombre d'empreintes que comprend chaque moule.</p><p id="p0065" num="0065">Dans une forme simplifiée de réalisation, le dispositif selon l'invention ne comprend que les postes A, C et F, le plateau supérieur 38 du moule étant alors<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> fixé à demeure sous le plateau supérieur 58 de la presse. Dans ce cas, les opérations de tassement du mélange dans le moule, de compactage et de maintien en place des plateaux du moule pendant l'expansion contrariée du plâtre, sont réalisées au niveau de la presse. La cadence de fabrication est alors d'une vingtaine de blocs par heure (si l'on n'utilise que des moules à empreinte unique), mais est obtenue au moyen d'une machine relativement simple ne comprenant que des postes de remplissage des moules et de démoulage des blocs et une presse hydraulique. Deux ouvriers suffisent pour assurer le fonctionnement de cette machine.</p><p id="p0066" num="0066">Inversement, lorsque le dispositif selon l'invention est conçu pour offrir une cadence de production élevée, il peut être prévu en sortie d'une installation de production de plâtre et utiliser alors le plâtre chaud sortant directement de cette installation, ce qui réduit d'ailleurs la durée de l'expansion contrariée et est favorable à l'augmentation de la cadence de production.</p><p id="p0067" num="0067">On a représenté schématiquement dans les figures 7 et 8 une variante de réalisation du moule selon l'invention.</p><p id="p0068" num="0068">Dans cette variante, le moule constitué essentiellement des quatre parois verticales 30, du plateau supérieur 38 et du plateau inférieur 40, est ceinturé et supporté par au moins un cadre rigide 86 de forme rectangulaire sur les côtés duquel les parois verticales 30 du moule sont fixées de façon démontable. Deux côtés adjacents du cadre 86 comportent des moyens 88 associés aux parois verticales 30 correspondantes du moule pour les déplacer transversalement vers l'intérieur et vers l'extérieur du moule, comme indiqué par les doubles flèches en figure 8, sur une faible distance, par exemple de l'ordre de 1 à 10 mm environ. Ces moyens 88 peuvent être mécaniques, par exemple à vis, à came ou à levier, ou hydrauliques.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --></p><p id="p0069" num="0069">La base du cadre 86 peut également comprendre des moyens 90 sur lesquels repose le plateau inférieur 40 du moule.</p><p id="p0070" num="0070">De plus, le plateau supérieur 38 du moule comporte des moyens 92, par exemple mécaniques, de verrouillage en position entre les parois verticales 30 lorsque le plateau supérieur 38 se trouve à une distance prédéterminée du plateau inférieur 40, cette distance étant égale à la hauteur du bloc à fabriquer.</p><p id="p0071" num="0071">On va maintenant décrire, en référence à la figure 9, la façon dont le moule des figures 7 et 8 est utilisé pour la fabrication de blocs de construction selon l'invention.</p><p id="p0072" num="0072">L'installation représentée en figure 9 comprend un certain nombre de postes A, B, C, D, E, F et G auxquels le moule des figures 7 et 8 est successivement amené par des moyens de transfert représentés schématiquement par les flèches joignant les divers postes de la figure 9. Avantageusement, ces moyens de transfert vont agir sur le cadre 86 qui ceinture et supporte le moule proprement dit.</p><p id="p0073" num="0073">Le premier poste A de l'installation de la figure 9 est un poste de remplissage du moule par un mélange de plâtre, de sable et d'eau. A ce poste, le plateau inférieur 40 du moule est en appui sur les moyens de support 90, et les deux parois verticales mobiles 30 du moule ont été rapprochées, pour délimiter entre elles et avec des deux autres parois verticales 30 un volume de moulage à la dimension du bloc à fabriquer. Le plateau supérieur 38 du moule a été écarté, pour permettre le remplissage du moule par le mélange de plâtre, de sable et d'eau.</p><p id="p0074" num="0074">Au poste suivant B, le plateau supérieur 38 est placé sur le moule et le mélange humide placé dans le moule peut être légèrement tassé et comprimé comme déjà décrit en référence à la figure 6.<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --></p><p id="p0075" num="0075">Le poste suivant C est le poste de compression lente du mélange dans le moule, et comprend une presse qui va agir sur le plateau supérieur 38 pour comprimer le mélange dans le moule jusqu'à la côte de hauteur désirée du bloc à fabriquer. A la fin de cette compression, les moyens 92 sont actionnés pour bloquer le plateau supérieur 38 en position sur les parois verticales 30 du moule, puis le moule et son cadre 86 sont transférés du poste C au poste E d'ouverture du moule, la durée du trajet entre ces deux postes correspondant à la durée de la phase d'expansion contrariée D du plâtre dans le moule. Cette durée peut être suffisante pour que l'hydratation du plâtre soit complète entre les postes C et E, ce qui garantit la stabilité dimensionnelle des blocs après leur démoulage.</p><p id="p0076" num="0076">Au poste E, les moyens 92 sont actionnés pour libérer le plateau supérieur 38 et les moyens 88 sont également actionnés pour écarter vers l'extérieur les deux parois mobiles 30 du moule.</p><p id="p0077" num="0077">Le moule et son cadre 86 sont ensuite transférés au poste F où il suffit de soulever le plateau inférieur 40 pour démouler le bloc de construction. Du fait de l'écartement préalable des parois mobiles 30 du moule, ce démoulage s'effectue sans problème et sans frottement du bloc sur les faces internes des parois 30 du moule, et donc sans usure sensible de ces faces.</p><p id="p0078" num="0078">Le moule et son cadre 86 sont ensuite transférés au poste G, qui est un poste de nettoyage du moule, par exemple au moyen de jets d'air sous pression ou de jets d'eau sous pression, et qui peut être aussi éventuellement un poste de pose d'une plaque de parement sur la face interne d'une des parois 30 du moule.</p><p id="p0079" num="0079">Le moule et le cadre 86 sont enfin ramenés au poste de remplissage A, où les moyens 88 peuvent être à nouveau actionnés pour replacer les parois mobiles 30 en<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> position de moulage, avant le remplissage du moule par le mélange de plâtre, de sable et d'eau.</p><p id="p0080" num="0080">Le moule des figures 7 et 8 présente des avantages très importants, dans la mesure où il permet d'éviter tout problème au démoulage, et d'effectuer une hydratation totale du plâtre sous pression dans le moule, tout en garantissant une précision dimensionnelle élevée de l'ordre du 10ème de millimètre sur le bloc de construction ainsi fabriqué.</p><p id="p0081" num="0081">Le cadre 86 qui ceinture le moule est de construction robuste pour être rigide et indéformable. Les cadres 86 équipés chacun d'un moule peuvent être juxtaposés, par exemple par deux ou par quatre, pour être transférés ensemble d'un poste à l'autre dans l'installation de la figure 9, qui est alors équipée d'une presse multiple, pour doubler ou quadrupler la cadence de fabrication.</p><p id="p0082" num="0082">Le procédé et le dispositif selon l'invention sont applicables à la fabrication d'éléments et de blocs de construction ayant des formes et des dimensions différentes de celles du bloc représenté dans les figures 1 à 3, et notamment des blocs pleins, des blocs à cavités multiples, des éléments plans, des chaîneaux, etc...</p>

As the product release valve is pressed, the liquefied propellant immediately vaporizes forcing the product spray out of the dispenser in the form of a fine mist.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">A second type of aerosol dispenser, the cheese spread dispenser being a common example, discharges the product, not as a fine mist, but as a solid. In this second category of aerosol dispensers, the propellant exists within the dispenser as a gas and does not mix with the product. Rather, it forms a separate layer over the product to be discharged. As the product release valve is pressed, the propellant, being under pressure, pushes the product out of the dispenser.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The most commonly used propellants are butane, nitrogen and chlorinated fluorohydrocarbons (CFC's), such as those sold under trade name of Freon. CFC's and butane are often preferred over nitrogen since their vapor pressures are independent of the volume of free headspace in the dispenser. Thus, as long as some of the CFC or butane is present in the dispenser, the pressure exerted on the product is virtually constant throughout the discharge life of the system.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">However, both CFC's and butane have adverse effects on the environment. CFC's add to the destruction of the earth's protective ozone layer which has lead the world community to seek a complete ban of CFC usage. Many countries have already banned its use or have implemented programs and schedules designed to eliminate CFC usage in the near future. Butane, on the other hand, is extremely flammable, making storage, handling and use of butane charged containers very hazardous. In addition, butane contaminates the flavor and smell of the dispensed product, thereby further restricting its use.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Although nitrogen is available as a substitute propellant, its vapor pressure is such that as product is dispensed, the propellant pressure decreases. Therefore, the product cannot be dispensed at a constant pressure through the life of the product, and at some point, the propellant pressure will fall below that needed to propel any product from the dispenser. To enable all of the product to be dispensable, the nitrogen must be pressurized to dangerously high levels increasing the risk of rupture or requiring more costly dispenser construction.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">It is an object of the present invention to overcome or mitigate the above disadvantage.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">This object is achieved by the invention claimed in Claim 1.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Canadian Patent Application CA-A-2013636 discloses an apparatus according to the pre-characterising part of claim 1.

A piston 40 operates within the cylinder 36, the outer diameter of the piston 40 being slightly less than the inner diameter of the cylinder 36 to permit reciprocal movement of the piston 40 in the cylinder 36 and to define a flow passage therebetween. Two axially spaced annular grooves are provided near the respective ends of the piston 40 and receive two sealing members, preferably in the form of O-rings, 42 and 44.

In the position shown in FIG. 2A, the piston 40 is in its upper position in which its upper end engages the plug 34, thereby preventing any further upward movement of the piston 40.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Before operation, the chambers 38 and 46 of the vessel 32 are charged to respective predetermined pressures with a quantity of inert gas such as air, nitrogen, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide or the like. The chamber 46 is charged to a pressure that is approximately equal to the pressure found in the headspace 14 needed to propel the product 12 from the container 10. The chamber 38 is pressurized to a greater pressure than the chamber 46 to recharge the headspace 14 as is described below.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">To charge the chamber 46, the piston 40 is moved downwardly such that the upper O-ring 42 is below the opening 36a of the cylinder 36. Then, pressurized gas is introduced from the opening 32c of the vessel 32 through the bore 34a of the plug 34, which gas passes through the opening 36a of the cylinder 36 and into the chamber 38. Once the pressure in the chamber 38 reaches a predetermined level, the plug 34 is removed and the piston 40 is raised such that the lower O-ring 44 is above the opening 36a of the cylinder 36 to allow the<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> gas to pass through the opening 36a and fill the chamber 46. The piston 40 is then lowered to the position shown in FIG. 2A such that the lower O-ring 44 is below the opening 36a to seal the gas in the chamber 46. The piston 40 is prevented from ejecting from the cylinder 36 by the reinsertion of the plug 34, or as shown in FIG. 2B by the neck 32b of the vessel 32 which is folded down to partially block the opening 32c.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">To charge the chamber 38, the piston 40 is further lowered such that the upper O-ring 42 is below the opening 36a of the cylinder 36.

Thereafter, the piston 40 is allowed to be urged to the position shown in FIG. 2A where the upper end of the piston 40 engages the plug 34. In this position, the upper O-ring 42 engages corresponding portions of the inner wall of the cylinder 36 to seal against the flow of the pressurized gas contained in the chamber 38 out of the vessel 32 and into the container 10 via the space between the piston 40 and the cylinder 36; while the lower O-ring 44 seals against the flow of gas to and from the chamber 46. While in this position, the pressure generator 30 can be moved and transported without accidentally depressurizing either of the chambers 38 or 46.<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">After the chambers 38 and 46 are charged, the pressure generator 30 is placed in the container 10 which contains the product 12 to be dispensed, and the headspace 14 in the container 10 is charged to a predetermined pressure with a gas similar to the gas used to charge the chambers 38 and 46 of the vessel 32, which pressure is selected to be initially greater than the combined force exerted on the piston 40 by the gas and the spring 48 in the chamber 46. After the container 10 is sealed off, or closed, the pressure in the container 10 acts through the opening 32c of the vessel 32 via the bore 34a of the plug 34 on the upper end of the piston 40 to force it downwardly to the operating position shown in FIG. 2B. In this operating position, both O-rings 42 and 44 engage the inner wall of the cylinder 36 to prevent any flow of the pressurized gas through the cylinder 36, and the upper O-ring 42 extends between the opening 36a and the notch 36b.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The piston 40 remains in the position shown in FIG. 2B until the container 10 is used by manually pressing the push button 26, in which case the pressure in the headspace 14 of the container 10 propels the product 12 through the tube 28, the valve 22, the stem 24 and outwardly through the openings in the push button 26. This causes the pressure in the container 10 to decrease until the pressures exerted on the lower end of the piston 40 by the pressurized gas in the chamber 46 and the spring 48 (if present) are greater than the corresponding pressure acting on the upper end of the piston 40 by the pressurized product 12 in the container 10. Upon this occurring, the piston 40 moves upwardly until the upper O-ring 42 extends in the notch 36b of the cylinder 36. This permits the high pressure<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> gas in the chamber 38 to pass through the opening 36a, through the space between the outer surface of the piston 40 and the inner surface of the cylinder 36, through the notch 36b and outwardly through the upper opening 32c of the vessel 32.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The pressure in the container 10 is thus increased accordingly until the pressure exerted thereby on the upper end of the piston 40 is sufficient to overcome the pressure exerted on the lower end of the piston 40 by the spring 48 and the pressure in the chamber 46. At this point, the piston 40 will move back to the position shown in FIG. 2B thus blocking any further flow of high pressure gas from the chamber 38 into the container 10 as described above. Note however, that should the pressure in the container 10 quickly drop a significant amount, such as due to a leak, the pressure in the chamber 46 will force the piston 40 against the plug 34 (or the folded down neck 32c), thereby sealing the high pressure gas in the chamber 38 by the upper O-ring 42.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">This back-and-forth movement of the piston 40 relative to the cylinder 36 continues in the manner described above as the product 12 is periodically dispensed from the container 10.

EP	0600893	B1	2000-03-22	en	DESCR	1	<heading id="h0001"><u>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">The invention relates to novel genes, vectors aid Bacilli transformed with them useful in the hyperproduction of enzymes. Specifically, the invention relates to specific combinations of unlinked genes which, either mutated or wild type, synergistically induce hyperproduction of enzymes.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">Marry industrially important products are produced from members of the genus Bacilli. Some of these include proteases, amylases, and beta-glucanases (Priest, 1977, Bacteriological Review, 41:711-753). Most of these enzymes are either produced by Bacilli after the initiation of sporulation or are timed with the onset of the stationary phase.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003"><u>Bacillus</u> <u>subtilis</u> I-168 is the most extensively studied member of the Bacilli and has a well developed genetic system as the result of many years of academic research. As a result, there is a considerable amount of knowledge pertaining to the expression of extracellular enzymes and many mutants of <u>B.</u> <u>subtilis</u> I-168 exist that are altered in the expression of these enzymes. There are several different known genes which code for proteins that regulate the expression of extracellular enzymes. Although the exact molecular mechanism of this regulation is not completely understood, it is now clear that the product of these genes interact either directly or indirectly at the transcriptional level of the target enzymes (Ferrari et al, 1988, J. Bacteriol. 170:289-295; Henner et al, 1988, J. Bacteriol. 170:296-300).</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Regions of the DNA around promoters can actively interact with certain transcriptional control factors and effectively regulate the strength and<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> efficiency of a particular promoter. This interaction will result either in a stimulation or in a repression of the transcription of that particular target gene. As a consequence, mutations in either the genes coding for these transcriptional control factors or in regions of the chromosome with which they interact are expected to yield more or less mRNA of the target gene. This in turn will results in higher or lower amount of enzyme synthesized by the cell.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">With the advent of genetic engineering techniques, it has been possible to clone and express a gene from another species in <u>B.</u> <u>subtilis</u> I-168 or other Bacillus species. Most of these studies have involved the use of multicopy plasmids as cloning vectors. Although the yield of the cloned protein was increased significantly over the production in the wild type host, it was far below the yield of enzyme reported for production strains obtained through mutagenesis. This was also the case when the enzyme was under the control of strong transcriptional and translational elements derived from <u>B.</u> <u>subtilis</u>. Apparently the production of enzyme obtained from the multicopy, replicating plasmids was not affected by the presence of certain mutations, i.e. <u>sacU(Hy)</u>, <u>sacQ(Hy)</u> and <u>hpr</u> (Dedonder et al, Microbiology 1976, D. Schlessinger (Ed), pp 58-69, American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC; Palva et al. 1983, FEMS Microbiology Letters, 17:81-85; Ferrari, unpublished observation), described as being able to induce hyperproduction of several secreted enzymes. These regulatory genes are unlinked to the structural gene for the affected enzymes and therefore one should expect that they exert their stimulating activity to a greater degree also when the gene is present in a multicopy plasmid.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">There are at least 6 different regulatory genes known to interact either directly or indirectly with the transcription of the subtilisin gene: <u>sacU</u>, <u>sacQ</u>, <u>prtR</u>, <u>hpr</u>, <u>sin</u> and <u>abrB</u>.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Certain mutations in the <u>sacU</u> gene encode for a modified polypeptide which has the most pleiotropic effect among all these known regulatory genes. A strain carrying for example <u>sacU</u>(Hy) mutations can sporulate in presence of high levels of glucose, has a very low efficiency of transformation, lacks flagella and it is also responsible for the hyperproduction of several secreted enzymes. (Dedonder et al, Microbiology 1976, see above).</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The <u>sacQ</u> gene from three different bacilli has been cloned and characterized (Amory et al, 1987, J. Bacteriol, 169, 234; Yang et al, 1986, J. Bacteriol, 166, 133; and Tomioka et al, 1985, J. Biotechnol 3,85). The gene isolated from <u>B.</u> <u>subtilis</u> encodes a 46 amino acid polypeptide. The <u>sacQ</u> gene when hyperexpressed either because of a mutation in its promoter or when present in a multicopy plasmid causes hyper production of certain extracellular enzymes, including the alkaline protease (Yang et al, 1986, J. Bacteriol <u>166</u>, 113-119).</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The <u>prtR</u> gene encodes a 60 amino acid polypeptide. When this gene is present in <u>B.</u> <u>subtilis</u> in a multicopy plasmid it causes increased production of proteins. However, unlike for sacQ, there have been no chromosomal mutations to date for this gene which increase proteases production (Yang et al., 1987, J. Bacteriol. <u>169</u>, 434-437).</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The <u>hpr</u> gene encodes a 203 amino acid protein and certain mutations in this gene stimulate alkaline protease production. It has been established that<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> mutations which cause the loss of this gene product stimulates transcription of the subtilisin gene (Perego and Hoch, 1988, J. Bacteriol. <u>170</u>, 2560-2567). The product of the <u>hpr</u> gene therefore is most likely a repressor of the subtilisin gene. It has also been determined that the <u>scoC</u> gene and possibly the <u>catA</u> gene are identical to the <u>hpr</u>. The notation <u>hpr</u> will be used thereafter to refer to any of the three alleles called <u>hpr</u>, <u>scoC</u> or <u>catA</u>.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The <u>sin</u> gene encodes a polypeptide of 111 amino acids (Gaur et al, 1986, J. Bacteriol, 168:860-869). An insertional inactivation of the gene causes the production of a higher level of alkaline protease, suggesting that this gene also acts as a repressor of the expression of alkaline protease.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Finally the <u>abrB</u> gene codes for a polypeptide of 97 amino acids. Also for this gene there is evidence that it is a repressor of the transcription of the alkaline protease and might have an important role in the temporal regulation of this gene.</p><heading id="h0003"><u>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u></heading><p id="p0013" num="0013">It has been surprisingly discovered that a synergistic effect can be achieved in a strain carrying combinations of mutations in these genes. Such organism when transformed with an integrative vector or plasmid in which the enzyme to be expressed is under the control of the promoter with all its regulatory regions, will express more enzyme than predictable from using either a replicative multicopy plasmid or only one of the above described regulatory mutated genes.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Accordingly, the invention relates to a Bacillus able to hyperproduce an enzyme comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>a) the enzyme gene sequence;</li><li>b) a functional promoter gene sequence controlling the expression of the enzyme gene operably linked to the enzyme gene sequence; and</li><li>c) two or more mutated genes involved in the transcriptional regulation of the promoter wherein each individual mutated gene induces the increased production of the enzyme.

Two mutated genes as described above are introduced in a strain carrying an appropriate promoter and gene sequence. The promoter sequence and the gene sequence of the enzyme are introduced into such host strain by mean of an integrative<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> vector. Such vector, which may or may not be amplified upon integration, is stably maintained as part of the host genome and replicates within the cell as integral part of its chromosome. Integration can occur at different region of the chromosome including but not limited to the region of homology with the promoter used in a particular construction. Such host may have its original enzyme sequences, or other gene sequences, deleterious to the desired enzyme production, deleted or otherwise made inoperative by standard techniques.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">As used herein, the "enzyme gene sequence" refers to a DNA sequence encoding for the expression of an enzyme, in general either heterologous or homologous to Bacilli. Several enzymes are known and within the scope of this teaching including but not limited to those preferred enzymes from <u>Bacillus</u> <u>lentus</u>, <u>Bacillus</u> <u>amyloliquefaciens</u> (e.g., ATCC 23844), <u>Bacillus</u> <u>licheniformis</u> (e.g., ATCC 21415), <u>Bacillus</u> <u>alcalophilus</u> (e.g., ATCC 21522), <u>B.</u> <u>subtilis</u> (e.g., ATCC 6051) and <u>Bacillus</u> <u>cereus</u> (e.g., ATCC 21768). Also included are all the genes capable of being expressed in Bacillus such as the ones coding for proteases, lipases, cutinases, esterases, endoglycosidases, etc. A preferred enzyme as subtilisin. Other preferred enzymes include endoglycosidase H from Streptomyces species and lipase from <u>Pseudomonas</u> <u>mendocino</u> ATCC 53552 (available from American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD). Enymes such as subtilisin which act at an optimum at higher pH are among the preferred enzymes. It is also recognized that only those promoters which are affected (i.e. hyperproduce) by each of the transcriptional regulatory genes alone are intended to be covered by the invention (e.g. <u>aprE</u> and <u>nprE</u>). The enzyme gene sequence also includes the DNA sequence encoding for a naturally occurring enzyme gene sequence which is modified to produce a mutant DNA<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> sequence which encodes a substitution, insertion or deletion of one or more amino acids in the gene sequence. Suitable modification methods are disclosed in, for example, EPO Publication No. 0130756, published January 9, 1985.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Subtilisins are bacterial alkaline proteases which generally act to cleave peptide bonds of proteins or peptides. As used herein, "subtilisin" means a naturally occurring subtilisin or a recombinant subtilisin. A series of naturally occurring subtilisins is known to be produced and often secreted by various bacterial species. Amino acid sequences of the members of this series are not entirely homologous. However, the subtilisins in this series exhibit the same or similar type of proteolytic activity. This class of serine proteases shares a common amino acid sequence defining a catalytic triad which distinguishes them from the chymotrypsin related class of seine proteases. The subtilisins and chymotrypsin related serine proteases both have a catalytic triad comprising aspartate, histidine and serine. In the subtilisin related proteases the relative order of these animo acids, reading from the amino to carboxyl terminus is aspartate-histidine-serine. In the chymotrypsin related proteases the relative order, however, is histidine-aspartate-serine. Thus, subtilisin herein refers to a serine protease.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">"Recombinant subtilisin" refers to a subtilisin in which the DNA sequence encoding the subtilisin is modified to produce a mutant DNA sequence which encodes the substitution, deletion or insertion of one or more amino acids in the naturally occurring subtilisin amino acid sequence. Suitable methods to produce such modification include those disclosed herein and in EPO Publication No. 0130756. For example, a subtilisin multiple mutant<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> containing the substitution of methionine at amino acid residues 50, 124 and 222 with phenylalanine, isoleucine and glutamine, respectively, can be considered to be derived from the recombinant subtilisin containing the substitution of glutamine at residue 222 (Gln-222) disclosed in EPO Publication No. 0130756. The multiple mutant thus is produced by the substitution of phenylalanine for methionine at residue 50 and isoleucine for methionine at residue 124 in the Gln-222 recombinant subtilisin.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">As used herein, "a functional promoter sequence controlling the expression of the enzyme gene operably linked to the enzyme gene sequence" refers to a promoter sequence which controls the transcription and translation of the coding sequence in Bacillus. The promoter sequence is chosen so that it is functional in the microorganism chosen for expression. For example, promoter sequence (including ribosomal binding sites) formed from Lambda P (Renaut, <u>et al., Gene 15</u>, 81 [1981]) as well as the <u>trp</u> (Russell, <u>et al.,</u> Gene 20, 23 (1982)or tac (de Boer <u>et al</u>., PNAS. USA <u>80</u>, 21 [1983]) may be operably linked to coding sequences to express alkaline protease in E. Coli. When <u>B.</u> <u>subtilis</u> I-168 is the expression host, the B. <u>subtilis</u> alkaline protease promoter (Stahl et al, J. Bacteriol 158, 411-418 [1984]) alpha amylase promoter of <u>B.</u> <u>subtilis</u> (Yang et al., 1983, Nucleic Acids Res. 11, 237-249) or <u>B.</u> <u>amyloliquefaciens</u> (Tarkinen, <u>et al,</u> J. Biol. Chem. 258, 1007-1013 [1983]), the neutral protease promoter from <u>B.</u> <u>subtilis</u> (Yang et al, J. Bacteriol, 160, 15-21 [1984]) or any other promoter from <u>B.</u> <u>subtilis</u> or other related Bacilli, whose expression is affected by the described upstream regulatory genes my be used. The preferred promoter of the invention is the <u>aprE</u> promoter. Also preferred is the <u>nprE</u> promoter.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">As used herein, "transcriptional regulatory genes" refers to any of the genes whose product affects the level of transcription from the enzyme promoter. These genes product can interact at the promoter level (e.g. AbrB) or with a region upstream or downstream of it (e.g. Hpr, SacU, SacQ, PrtR, Sin) either directly or indirectly. The definition above is comprehensive of the gene product or the lack of it and any possible mutation which my increase the level of transcription of a particular promoter (e.g. multiple copies). This definition is meant to include but not limited to certain mutations in the promoter region, downstream or upstream of the promoter region of the target gene which my result in an increase in transcription due to a better interaction or lack of it with the regulatory genes or with the transcriptional machinery (e.g. RNA polymerase, mutations which decrease production of a gene product which interferes with transcription). These genes and the effect of their mutations are described above. These specific combinations, applicant has discovered, exhibit a synergistic effect when compared with the results predicted from either single mutations alone.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">It appears that in order to express the enzyme at high levels aid have its expression more effectively under the control of these regulatory mutations the promoter needs to be integrated into the genome of the host <u>Bacillus</u> cell or perhaps be carried by a low copy number plasmid. High copy number replicating plasmids carrying the enzyme gene seem to be poorly tolerated in strains bearing some of the regulatory mutations, and they are lost or rearranged at very high frequency.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">It is preferred that the gene coding for the enzyme to be expressed at high levels is integrated into the genome of the host <u>Bacillus</u> cell.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">"Expression vector" refers to a DNA construct containing a DNA sequence which is operably linked to a suitable control sequence capable of effecting the expression of the DNA in a suitable host. Such control sequences can include a promoter to effect transcription or optional operation sequence to control such transcription, a sequence encoding a suitable ribosome binding sites (RBS) and sequences which control termination of transcription and translation. The vector may be a plasmid, a phage particle, or a potential genomic insert. Once transformed into a suitable host, the vector may replicate and function independently of the host gene or may integrate into the gene itself.

Briefly, partially <u>Sau3A</u> digested chromosomal DNA from <u>B.</u> <u>amyloliquefaciens</u> was ligated to <u>BamH1</u> digested pBS42 and used to transform <u>E.</u> <u>coli</u>. pBS42 is a plasmid vector composed of an origin of replication from pUB110 recognized as such by <u>B.</u> <u>subtilis</u>, an origin of replication from pBR322 which allows replication of the plasmid in <u>E.</u> <u>coli</u> and a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT or CmR) from pC194, a fully characterized plasmid from <u>Staphilococcus</u> <u>aureus</u> (Horinouchi and Weisblum, 1982), which can express CmR in both <u>E.</u> <u>coli</u> and <u>B.</u> <u>subtilis</u>. Synthetic DNA probes designed from the known amino acid sequence of the subtilisin were used to isolate a plasmid (p54) carrying the DNA coding for the gene. The isolated DNA fragment was able to code for subtilisin production when transferred to <u>B.</u> <u>subtilis</u> and the DNA sequence translated to match the published amino acid sequence of the alkaline protease (Wells et al, 1983, <u>Nucleic Acid Res. 11</u>:<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> 7911-7925).</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">A <u>Sau3A</u> <u>BamH1</u> fragment from pS4-5 (a derivative of pS4) comprising the subtilisin structural gene from the 8th codon of the signal sequence to 250 bp after the 3' end of the gene (all of which is <u>B.</u> <u>amyloliquefaciens</u> DNA), was fused to a 750 bp <u>EcoR1-Sau3A</u> fragment which carries the promoter and the first 8 codons of the translated sequence of the <u>B.</u> <u>subtilis</u> subtilisin gene (Fig. 1). The gene so reconstructed, carried in an <u>EcoR1-BamH1</u> fragment containing only <u>Bacillus</u> DNA, was inserted in <u>BamH1-EcoR1</u> digested pBS42 resulting in plasmid pSAR. This plasmid was shown to be able to produce subtilisin in <u>B.</u> <u>subtilis</u>.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The <u>EcoR1-BamH1</u> fragment from pSAR, carrying the <u>B.</u> <u>subtilis</u> aprE promoter fused to the <u>B.</u> <u>amyloliquefaciens</u> subtilisin gene was ligated to an <u>EcoR1-BamH1</u> digested pJH101 (Ferrari, et al, <u>Journal of Bacterial.</u> Vol. 154, pp 1513-1515). The resulting plasmid, which can replicate in <u>Escherichia. coli</u> but not in <u>B.</u> <u>subtilis</u> was called pSA1. Upon transformation in <u>B.</u> <u>subtilis</u>, followed by Chloramphenicol selection, this plasmid will integrate into the chromosome at the site of homology with the <u>aprE</u> promoter.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">The CmR gene from pC194, contained in a 1.6 Kilobases (Kb) <u>ClaI</u> fragment, was cloned in <u>ClaI</u> digested pBR322.

Upon digestion with <u>EcoR1</u> and <u>HindIII</u>, this plasmid will release a 2.2 Kb fragment carrying the subtilisin gene flanked on one side by 17 bp of the synthetic linker (Fig. 2).</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">These two <u>EcoR1-HindIII</u> fragments were ligated together and used to transform <u>B.</u> <u>subtilis</u>, selecting for CmR. Upon transformation this plasmid integrates into the chromosome, as has been shown by PBS1 transduction (Fig. 3). The final construction in <u>B.</u> <u>subtilis</u> consists of 1.6 Kb from pC194 and the subtilisin gene joined together by short linker regions. One linker is composed of 20 bp from pUC9, and the other one consists of the 17 bp from pBR322 included between the <u>EcoR1</u> and the <u>Cla1</u> sites.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">In order to obtain a strain which produces mainly the protease we are interested in, we deleted the two major proteases, present in almost all Bacilli (the alkaline protease aid the neutral protease), as described by Stahl and Ferrari (1984), <u>J. Bacteriol., 158</u>: 411-418 and Yang et al (1984), <u>J. Bacteriol., 160</u>: 15-21. The plasmid described above was then introduced into BG 2036 by transformation selecting for CmR. This plasmid similarly to pSAI will integrate into the chromosome (we have never been able to detect any replicating plasmids) in the region of homology conferred by the <u>B.</u> <u>subtilis</u> subtilisin promoter (Fig. 3). Southern blot analysis of the chromosomal DNA digested with proper restriction enzymes and PBS1 mapping experiments confirmed the integration and the presence of the proper size fragments.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">To obtain hyperproduction we then introduced chromosomal mutations known to increase the level of secreted enzymes, either through competent cell transformation or PBS1 transduction. Both these techniques are commonly<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> used for genetic studies in <u>B.</u> <u>subtilis</u>. The resulting strain is a prototrophic sporeforming derivative of <u>B.</u> <u>subtilis</u> I-168 (catalog No. 1-A1, Bacillus Genetic Stock Center) which carries the <u>B.</u> <u>amyloliquefaciens</u> subtilisin gene and the CmR gene from pC194 integrated into the chromosome.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037"><u>Construction of Hpr97, ScoC, Cat A strains</u>: All the strains construction described here have been carried at by using standard <u>B.</u> <u>subtilis</u> genetic techniques. Transformations have been done following the method described by Anagnostopoulos and Spizizen (J. Bacteriol., 81:741-746, 1961). Transduction have been done using the bacteriophage PBS1, following the method described by Hoch et al., (J. Bacteriol., 93:1925-1937, 1967). The integrative plasmid pSAI was introduced into strain BG2097 (a strain publicly available which carries deletions in the <u>aprE</u> and <u>nprE</u> genes) by transformation to generate strain BG3002. DNA prepared from BG3002 was used to transform strains IPCC 7698 (available from the Pasteur Institute Culture Collection, Paris, France), 1A151 (available from the Bacillus Genetic Stock Center, Columbus, Ohio) and Hpr97 (available from Dr J. A. Hoch, Research Institute of Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, California) containing respectively the <u>scoC1</u>, <u>catA</u> or <u>hpr-97</u> mutation to chloramphenicol resistance. The resulting chloramphenicol resistant strains were scored on solid medium (tryptose blood agar base agar, TBAB) containing skim milk for the detection of the hyperprotease producing characteristic (due to the presence of the <u>scoC</u>, <u>catA</u> and <u>hpr</u> mutations) of the parent strain. PBS-1 lysates (see above) were prepared on the ScoC, CatA and Hpr strains carrying the pSAI integrative plasmid by a standard published technique (Hoch et al 1967, see above). These lysates were used to transduce strain BG2097. These transductions introduced the subtilisin gene integrated in the chromosome with plasmid pSAI into BG2097 and also<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> transferred the <u>scoC</u> or <u>catA</u> or <u>hpr</u> mutations by virtue of their linkage to the <u>aprE</u> gene (that is pSAI). Approximately 10-20% of the chloramphenicol resistant transductants demonstrated a higher amount of protease production, suggesting that these strains had indeed acquired the <u>scoC</u> or <u>catA</u> or <u>hpr</u> hyperproducing phenotype.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Some of the transductant were screened on plates containing 1.6% skim milk and compared to BG3002. Transductants able to yield a larger halo on these type of plates were selected and strains BG 3008, BG3005 aid BG3007 were obtained. The genotype of these strains is isogeneic (<u>hisA</u>, <u>aprE</u>, <u>nprE</u>, pSAI: :CmR) except for the <u>hpr</u> gene were the mutations <u>scoC1</u>, <u>catA</u> or <u>hpr</u>97 are present respectively. When representatives of this transduction were examined in shake flasks using a nutrient broth medium, they produced ∼19-17mg/L subtilisin or 5-10 fold more than the strain that did not contain the hyperproducing mutation.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039"><u>Construction of SacU(Hy) strains</u>: One of the properties of SacU(Hy) strains is that they lack the ability to produce flagella and to become motile. Since PBS-1 attaches to motile flagella, it is impossible to prepare a PBS-1 working lysate on SacU(Hy) strains. This problem was circumvented by the isolation of a spontaneous mutant that was motile and retained its protease hyperproducing phenotype. The nature of the mutation that results in motility is unknown. A lysate was prepared on the motile SacU(Hy) strain. This lysate was used to transduce either BG3002 (Δ <u>apr</u>, Δ <u>npr</u>, <u>hisA</u>) containing the pSAI plasmid to histidine prototropy. Since the <u>sacU</u> gene and the <u>hisA</u> gene are linked by transduction, a certain percentage of the transductants were expected to contain the <u>sacU(Hy)</u>32 gene. The presence of this mutation was verified on skim milk plates; ∼90%<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> of the transductants exhibited the hyperproducing phenotype. A representative strain containing the <u>sacU(Hy</u>) mutation produced 35-45mg/L when grown in nutrient broth medium. The same general scheme applied when a strain containing the <u>scoC</u> or <u>catA</u> mutation was transduced with a PBS1 lysate prepared on a SacU(Hy) strain. Strains containing the <u>scoC</u> (BG3008) and <u>catA</u> (BG3005) mutations could be successfully transduced to <u>sacU(Hy)</u>. The strains containing both the <u>sacU(Hy)32</u> and either the <u>scoC</u> or <u>catA</u> mutations exhibited a larger zone of clearing on skim milk plates than did either of the strains containing the individual mutations. These strains produced ∼55mg/L in nutrient broth medium.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040"><u>Construction of SacQ(Hy) strains</u>: A lysate was prepared on a SacQ(Hy) strain. This lysate was used to transduce a strain to threonine prototropy. Again, since the <u>thr</u> gene and <u>sacQ(Hy)</u> gene are linked by transduction, a certain percentage of the population would be expected to contain the hyperproducing <u>sacQ(Hy)</u> gene. The same procedure is used to construct strains containing either the <u>sacQ(Hy)</u> mutation alone or in combination with either the <u>scoC</u> or <u>catA</u> mutation.</p><p id="p0041" num="0041"><u>Construction of triple mutants</u>: Strains containing the <u>sacU(Hy)32</u>, <u>sacQ(Hy)</u> and either the <u>scoC</u> or <u>catA</u> mutation could be constructed by using a combination of the above procedures. Generally speaking, the <u>catA/scoC</u> mutation was introduced in one step along with the plasmid pSAI followed by the introduction of the <u>sacQ(Hy)</u> mutation and finally the <u>sacU(Hy)</u> mutation was introduced into the strain.<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> <tables id="tabl0001" num="0001"><table frame="all"><tgroup cols="3" colsep="1" rowsep="0"><colspec colnum="1" colname="col1" colwidth="52.50mm"/><colspec colnum="2" colname="col2" colwidth="52.50mm"/><colspec colnum="3" colname="col3" colwidth="52.50mm"/><thead valign="top"><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col3" align="left">Results</entry></row><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col2" align="center">Strain</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="center">Enzyme Level Shake Flasks<sup>1</sup> (mg/l)</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">BG 3002</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left">(wild type) pSAI</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="char" char=".">0.5</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" morerows="1" align="left">BG 3004</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left"><u>sacU(Hy)</u>, pSAI</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="char" char=".">40</entry></row><row><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left"><u>sacU(Hy)</u>, pSAI, pBS7AS</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="char" char=".">36</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">BG 3005</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left"><u>catA</u>, pSAI</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="char" char=".">2</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">BG 3006</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left"><u>catA</u>, <u>sacU(Hy),</u> pSAI</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="char" char=".">56</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">BG 3007</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left"><u>hpr97</u>, pSAI</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="char" char=".">10</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">BG 3008</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left"><u>scoC</u>, pSAI</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="char" char=".">4</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">BG 3009</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left"><u>sacQ(Hy)</u>, pSAI</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="char" char=".">5</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">BG 3010</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left"><u>scoC</u>, <u>sacU(Hy)</u>, pSAI</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="char" char=".">60</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">BG 3013</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left"><u>sacQ(Hy)</u>, <u>sacU(Hy)</u>, pSAI</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="char" char=".">30</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">BG 3015</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left"><u>catA</u>, <u>sacQ(Hy)</u></entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="char" char=".">26</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">BG 3016</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left"><u>scoC</u>, <u>sacQ(Hy)</u></entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="char" char=".">27</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">BG 3017</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left"><u>catA</u>, <u>sacQ(Hy)</u>, <u>sacU(Hy)</u>, pSAI</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="char" char=".">55</entry></row><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">BG 3020</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left"><u>scoC</u>, <u>sacQ(Hy)</u>, <u>sacU(Hy)</u>, pSAI</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="char" char=".">89,61</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup cols="3" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><colspec colnum="1" colname="col1" colwidth="52.50mm"/><colspec colnum="2" colname="col2" colwidth="52.50mm"/><colspec colnum="3" colname="col3" colwidth="52.50mm"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col3" align="justify"><sup>1</sup> Medium: Schaeffers nutrient broth +0.1% glucose.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p>
