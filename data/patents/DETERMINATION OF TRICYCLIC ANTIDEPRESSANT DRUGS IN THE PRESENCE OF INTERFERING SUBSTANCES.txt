In particular, the present invention relates to the pretreatment of a test sample to permit the analytical determination of a tricyclic antidepressant drug which does not contain a sulfur moiety in the presence of one or more interfering substances.</p><heading id="h0002"><u>Background of the Invention</u></heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">The determination of analytes has become very useful in a variety of fields such as biochemical research, environmental and industrial testing, and especially medical diagnostics. The monitoring of therapeutic drug levels and other analytes in biological fluids such as serum, plasma, whole blood, urine, and the like, has become very useful to provide physicians with information to aid in patient management. The monitoring of such drug levels enables adjustment of patient dosage to achieve optimal therapeutic effects, and helps avoid either subtherapeutic or toxic levels.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A test sample may contain one or more detectable compounds having chemical structures which are substantially similar to, or which resemble, or which could resemble, and therefore be indistinguishable from, the desired analyte of interest. For example, in the area of medical diagnostics where it is important to monitor the level of therapeutic drugs, a number of drugs having substantially similar chemical structures may be administered to a patient wherein a test sample from such patient could contain detectable levels thereof.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In such instances, the analytical determination of the desired analyte may be interfered with by the presence of such one or more additional substances having substantially similar chemical structures to the chemical structure of the analyte of interest to thereby produce inconsistent and inaccurate results. In particular, where the analytical determination involves immunoassay techniques employing antibodies capable of binding to the analyte of interest, such antibodies may also bind or crossreact with such other substances having substantially similar chemical structures. Similarly, where the analytical determination involves high pressure liquid chromatography techniques or thin layer chromatography techniques, the elution profile of the analyte of interest may be indistinguishable from the elution profile of such other substances having substantially similar chemical structures.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">U.S. Patent No. 4,810,635 discloses a fluorescence energy transfer immunoassay for the detection of digoxin in a serum sample in which interfering endogenous fluorescence has been eliminated by treatment of the sample with a strong oxidizing agent. U.S. Patent No. 4,668,620 discloses an enzyme-label immunoassay in which a serum sample has been treated with a peracid compound to reduce or eliminate background interference contributed by serum components. U.S. Patent No. 4,829,012 discloses an immunoassay for IgM antibodies in a liquid sample, such as a biological fluid, in which interfering IgG antibodies are modified by the binding of the IgG antibodies to anti-IgG antibodies.

As would be understood by one skilled in the art, phenothiazines are often co-prescribed to a patient being treated with a tricyclic antidepressant drug wherein a test sample from such patient would therefore contain levels of both drugs. According to such preferred embodiment, such test sample is contacted with an oxidative reagent, preferably chloramine-T (sodium salt of N-chloro-4-methylbenzene sulfonamide) or chloramine-B (sodium salt of N-chlorobenzene sulfonamide), to selectively modify the chemical structure of the phenothiazines whereby the phenothiazines present in the test sample are selectively oxidized to their corresponding sulfoxides or sulfones.

It is to be understood that the analyte of interest and such interfering substances could be substantially dissimilar but, at the same time, could have conformational aspects in which they resemble each other.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In particular, analytes of interest include, but are not intended to be limited to, tricyclic antidepressant drugs such as amitriptyline, nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, protriptyline, doxepin, clomipramine and desdoxepin; and benzodiazepines such as diazepam.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In particular, interfering substances include, but are not intended to be limited to phenothiazines such as chloropromazine, desmethylchloropromazine, thioridazine, desmethylthioridazine, sulforidazine and mesoridazine, and thioxanthines such as thiothixene.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">According to the present invention, the pretreatment reagent is specific for and is capable of selectively modifying the chemical structure at one or more sites or positions of one or more interfering substances present in a test sample.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0015" num="0015">It is to be appreciated that once the chemical structure of the interfering substance has been modified according to the present invention, the analytical determination of the analyte can be made. Also according to the present invention, the pretreatment reagent can be selected from a variety of oxidative reagents capable of substantially modifying the chemical structure of the interfering substance. Such reagents include, but are not intended to be limited to N-chlorosulfonamides such as chloramine-T and chloramine-B; hypochlorites such as sodium hypochlorite and hypochlorous acid; hypobromites such as sodium hypobromite and hypobromous acid; peroxides such as sodium hydroperoxide; peracids such as perselenic acid and 3-chloroperbenzoic acid; and oxidative enzymes such as catalase, peroxidase and microperoxidase. For sulfur-containing interfering substances, such as phenothiazines, the pretreatment reagent is preferably selected from the group<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> consisting of sodium hypochlorite, catalase, and perselenic acid, more preferably chloramine-T.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">As would be understood by one skilled in the art apprised of the foregoing considerations and as will be described in greater detail in the specific embodiments and examples hereinbelow, selection of a particular pretreatment reagent will depend upon the chemical structure of the analyte of interest and the chemical structure of interfering substances which may be present in a test sample. It is to be understood that in addition to being added or introduced into a test sample from an external source, the oxidative reagent can alternatively be generated or otherwise formed <u>in</u> <u>situ</u>, such as the generation of hydrogen peroxide. For example, in the case of an analytical system containing the analyte of interest, an interfering substance as described herein, selenium dioxide, and glucose oxidase, to which glucose is added, hydrogen peroxide is formed <u>in</u> <u>situ</u>. This is particularly useful for the packaging of reagents in that the packaging and shipment of strong oxidizing agents can be avoided by providing reagents which can form, <u>in</u> <u>situ</u>, the oxidative reagent for use as described herein. In addition, the pretreatment reagent can be presented as a liquid reagent, a dry reagent, or immobilized to a solid support material according to methods known in the art.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Although the pretreatment reagent can be employed in the analytical systems as described above, the pretreatment reagent according to the present invention is especially useful in a fluorescent polarization immunoassay (FPIA) system. For example, in a competitive protein binding or immunoassay, a substance being measured, often referred to as a ligand, competes with a substance of close structural similarity coupled to a detectable moiety, often referred to as a tracer, for a limited number of binding sites on antibodies specific to the portion or portions of the ligand and tracer with structural similarity, shared with an immunogen employed to produce such antibodies. In a fluorescent polarization immunoassay, the detectable moiety component of the tracer is a fluorescent moiety selected from the group consisting of fluoresceins, aminofluoresceins, carboxyfluoresceins, fluoresceinamines, and the like.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">According to such FPIA format, the amount of tracer bound to the antibody varies inversely to the amount of ligand present in either the test sample or standard calibrator solution in a predictable manner. The relative, and therefore characteristic, binding affinities of the ligand and the tracer to the antibody binding site, are important parameters of the assay system. In particular, FPIA techniques are based on the principle that a fluorescent tracer, when excited by plane polarized light of<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> a characteristic wavelength, will emit light at another characteristic wavelength (i.e., fluorescence) that retains a degree of the polarization relative to the incident stimulating light that is inversely related to the rate of rotation of the tracer in a given medium. As a consequence of this property, a tracer substance with constrained rotation, such as in a viscous solution phase or when bound to another solution component with a relatively lower rate of rotation, will retain a relatively greater degree of polarization of emitted light than if in free solution. Therefore, within the time frame in which the ligand and tracer compete for binding to the antibody, the tracer and ligand binding rates should yield an appropriate proportion of free and bound tracer with the preservation of important performance parameters such as selectivity, sensitivity, and precision.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">For example, for the FPIA determination of imipramine, a test sample is contacted with the pretreatment reagent according to the present invention and with imipramine antiserum in the presence of an appropriately selected fluorescein derivative thereof which is capable of producing a detectable fluorescence polarization response to the presence of imipramine antiserum. Plane polarized light is then passed through the solution to obtain a fluorescent polarization response and the response is detected as a measure of the amount of imipramine present in the test<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> sample when compared to the response of standard calibrators prepared from the native compound.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">As described herein, the test sample containing the analyte of interest and such other interfering substances is a biological test sample such as whole blood, serum, plasma, urine, feces, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">According to the present invention, there is provided a test kit useful for the fluorescent polarization immunoassay determination of a tricyclic antidepressant drug present in a test sample, wherein said antidepressant drug does not contain a sulfur moiety and wherein said test sample includes a sulfur-containing compound having a chemical structure which is similar to said tricyclic antidepressant drug and is immunologically crossreactive with an antibody to said antidepressant drug, said test kit comprising (a) an oxidative reagent, or reagents which can generate hydrogen peroxide as an oxidative reagent in the test sample, said oxidative reagent being capable of modifying the chemical structure of said sulfur-containing compound by selectively oxidizing the sulfur moiety of said sulfur-containing compound without modifying the chemical structure of said tricyclic antidepressant drug, whereby crossreactive binding of said antibody to said tricyclic antidepressant drug to said modified sulfur-containing compound is reduced and (b) all essential additional reagents for performing the fluorescent polarization immunoassay determination including an antibody to said tricyclic antidepressant drug and a suitable fluorescent tracer compound.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p><p id="p0022" num="0022">According to the present invention, there is also provided a test kit useful for the chromatographic determination of a tricyclic antidepressant drug present in a test sample, wherein said antidepressant drug does not contain a sulfur moiety and wherein said test sample includes a sulfur-containing compound having a chemical structure which is similar to said tricyclic antidepressant drug and an elution profile which interferes with the elution profile of said tricyclic antidepressant drug, said test kit comprising (a) an oxidative reagent, or reagents which can generate hydrogen peroxide as an oxidative reagent in the test sample, said oxidative reagent being capable of modifying the chemical structure of said sulfur-containing compound by selectively oxidizing the sulfur moiety of said sulfur-containing compound without modifying the chemical structure of said tricyclic antidepressant drug, whereby the elution profile of said modified sulfur-containing compound does not interfere with the elution profile of said tricyclic antidepressant drug; and (b) all essential additional reagents for performing the chromatographic determination including an internal standard. Such test kit may be useful in a high pressure liquid chromatographic determination of said drug or useful in a thin layer chromatographic determination of said drug. The test kit is<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> presented in a commercially packaged form as a combination of one or more containers holding the necessary reagents, as a composition or admixture where the compatibility of the reagents will allow. Particularly preferred is a test kit for the fluorescent polarization immunoassay determination of tricyclic antidepressant drugs, comprising the appropriate pretreatment reagent according to the present invention, an appropriate fluorescent tracer compound, and an appropriate antibody reagent as described above. It is to be understood that the test kit can, of course, include other materials as are known in the art and which may be desirable from a commercial user standpoint, such as buffers, diluents, standards, and the like.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The present invention will now be illustrated, but is not intended to be limited, by the following examples:</p><heading id="h0006"><u>EXAMPLE 1</u></heading><heading id="h0007">Fluorescent Polarization Immunoassay For Imipramine and Desipramine</heading><p id="p0024" num="0024">In a fluorescent polarization immunoassay (FPIA) using an Abbott TDx® analytical system for imipramine (IMI) or desipramine (DMI), phenothiazines such as chlorpromazine may interfere with the determination of IMI and DMI. In particular, antibodies directed to IMI may recognize<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> chlorpromazine or desmethylchlorpromazine as well as imipramine when present in a patient sample. In order to prevent the error in quantitation that would result, the sample is treated with chloramine-T to oxidatively modify the structure of the chlorpromazine or desmethylchlorpromazine to a form much less well recognized by this antitricyclic immune serum.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">For the determination of imipramine, the sample (0.100 mL) was rendered basic by the addition of 0.100 mL of 0.25 M NaOH and dissociated from serum proteins by the addition of 0.025 mL of isoamyl alcohol. The mixture was allowed to stand for up to 5.0 minutes, after which time 0.50 mL of decane was added and the sample vortexed vigorously for 1.0 minute. The sample/decane biphasic mixture was then centrifuged for up to 5.0 minutes to clarify those phases. In the case of imipramine, 0.100 mL of the decane upper phase was transferred to a tube containing 0.100 mL of acidic buffer, pH 3, to which 0.010 mL of 20 microgram per mL of chloramine-T had been added. This amount of chloramine-T can completely modify up to 1.0 microgram of chlorpromazine in the original sample. Variations in the quantity of chloramine-T may be made to accommodate differing ranges of phenothiazine concentrations expected to be present in the sample. Table I below illustrates a typical example of results obtained from comparing the analysis of a sample containing, as in this case, 300 ng/mL<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> of chlorpromazine and 128 ng/mL of imipramine, employing an Abbott TDx analytical system. Chlorpromazine crossreacts with the antibody used in the FPIA for imipramine. This quantity of chlorpromazine yielded a significant overestimate of the amount of imipramine actually present in the sample (171%). Treatment of the sample extract with chloramine-T modifies the structure of the chlorpromazine in such a fashion that it is no longer an assay interferant. Inclusion of the chloramine-T treatment removed this overestimate entirely. <tables id="tabl0001" num="0001"><table frame="all"><title>TABLE I</title><tgroup cols="3" colsep="1" rowsep="0"><colspec colnum="1" colname="col1" colwidth="52.50mm"/><colspec colnum="2" colname="col2" colwidth="52.50mm"/><colspec colnum="3" colname="col3" colwidth="52.50mm"/><thead valign="top"><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col3" align="center">Removal Of Chlorpromazine Interferant In FPIA For Imipramine</entry></row><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">Sample</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left">Treatment</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="left">Mass</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">IMI</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left">NONE</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">128 ng/mL</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">IMI+300 ng CPZ</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left">NONE</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">219 ng/mL</entry></row><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">IMI+300 ng CPZ</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="left">Chloramine-T</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">130 ng/mL</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The procedure described above could also be followed for the analysis of desipramine in the presence of phenothiazines to achieve the elimination of interfering substances as described herein.<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --></p><heading id="h0008"><u>EXAMPLE 2</u></heading><heading id="h0009">High Pressure Liquid Chromatography Determination of Imipramine and Desipramine</heading><p id="p0027" num="0027">In the HPLC analysis of tricyclic antidepressants such as imipramine and desipramine, phenothiazines such as chlorpromazine or its metabolite, desmethylchlorpromazine, may interfere with the analysis of the tricyclic antidepressants or one of their metabolites.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">A 1.0 mL sample to which an internal standard substance was added was rendered basic by the addition of 0.200 mL of 1.0 M NaOH followed by the addition of 0.200 mL of isoamyl alcohol to inhibit analyte/protein interaction.
