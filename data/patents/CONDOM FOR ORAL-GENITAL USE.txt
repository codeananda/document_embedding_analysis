EP	0600858	B1	2000-05-17	en	DESCR	1	<heading id="h0001"><u><b>Background of the Invention</b></u></heading><p id="p0001" num="0001">In recent years, the appearance of the HIV virus and the impending Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome epidemic have created an atmosphere of fear, caution and prudence in which sexually active adults must consider protecting themselves from infection by HIV virus as well as other venereal diseases. It is generally accepted as fact that the condom provides the best protection from venereal disease and HIV virus, aside from complete sexual abstinence. Unfortunately, such a positive barrier device is, at present, the only sure or certain way to prevent transmission of all STD's, many of which cause great personal suffering and, in the cases of AIDS and syphilis, death.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">Condoms are generally designed to be applied to the male member, although recent adaptations have been introduced which permit their use by women in the form a liner for the vaginal canal. Such a condom is disclosed in US-A-4805604. However, a significant form of sexual activity, namely oral-genital sexual contact, has not been well served by the forms of condoms known in the prior art. Although many individuals do not openly discuss or acknowledge participating in such practices, many surveys have shown that oral-genital sex is highly desired and engaged in frequently. Commercially available condoms are not designed to facilitate or accommodate oral-genital sex. Moreover, the oral cavity, together with the lips and surrounding skin, provides many opportunities for disease transmission. Brushing and flossing of teeth, biting the cheek or tongue accidentally, or STD lesions in the mouth and throat areas all create breaks in the skin and mucosa that provide direct vectors to the blood. The present invention is directed toward a condom-like prophylactic that protects the oral cavity during oral sexual activity, so that disease transmission is blocked. It also protects the genitals, thus avoiding transmission in either direction. This is a unique solution to a very serious problem.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">The typical male condom device may be used to prevent skin-to-skin contact during fellatio, but it suffers from the same drawback for this use as for other uses; i.e., it<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> requires male arousal prior to use, so that the condom may be applied to the male member. If arousal can be achieved only through sensual contact, then the safety desired by the user of the condom may have been abrogated. Moreover, the typical male condom is required to engage the penis in a tight, compressive grip to prevent accidental removal during vaginal sex; this tight fit is undesirable for fellatio and uncomfortable for the fellatee. Examples of such condoms are disclosed in US-A-4872464 and US-A-4888007. These documents disclose a male condom with a shield surrounding the open end of the condom, said shield extending away from the open mouth of the condom.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Furthermore, the condoms known in the prior art are not designed to protect against skin-to-skin contact during cunnilingus. Devices have been invented to protect a person's tongue from contact with unpalatable medicine, as well as other devices such as impervious sheets and garments, but none of these inventions permit the practice of cunnilingus while eliminating the risk of disease transmission through direct contact. This is a major failing of the prior art, especially since many individuals participate in cunnilingus without protection, and such practices can be a major vector of disease transmission. Only one device has been proposed in the prior art that allows the performance of cunnilingus. That is the device disclosed in CA-A-1274352. That device comprises a facial mask which has a stretchable portion over the mouth to allow the extension of a wearers tongue. This device is, however, inelegant and unsatisfactory in use.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">From a commercial standpoint, surveys have shown that nearly 50% of condoms purchased are sold to women, although it is clear that condoms as known in the prior art are predominantly worn by the male. Therefore there is an implication that many women are concerned about contraception and disease prevention, and desirous of taking steps toward prevention of both. Many persons of both sexes may wish to participate in oral sex but hesitate. These "aesthetically fastidious" individuals may now safely and pleasurably benefit themselves and their sex partners, using the present invention. Studies show that only 50% of women achieve orgasm via penile/vaginal sex. One-half require oral or digital manipulation to achieve climax. Indeed, at present a woman who desires to achieve a climax via cunnilingus must do so unprotected. Combined with the facts that many women desire to<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> participate in cunnilingus and fellatio, clearly there is an unfilled need and a large market for condoms which permit the safe practice of oral sex.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">It should also be noted that condoms currently available on the market are not designed nor directed toward oral use. The lubricants typically provided in condom packages have odors and tastes that are at best inoffensive, and at worst are completely aversive.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention generally comprises a condom-like prophylactic designed to permit the practice of oral sex while preventing the transmission of venereal and other contagious diseases through oral-genital contact. In one aspect of the invention, there is provided a condom adapted to be worn in the mouth of the person practising oral sex, as described in claim 1.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The condom includes a tubular member having one closed end and formed of thin, pliant, impervious material. Joined to the open end of the tubular member are a pair of flanges extending generally radially outwardly and spaced closely together.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The flanges may be curved out of a plane transverse to the axis of the tubular member to define a channel having the general configuration of the lips and mouth of the average person. The device is gripped by placing the lips within the channel, and closing the jaws slightly to compress and retain the open end of the device. A third flange may be provided, generally parallel to the other flanges, to define a further channel in which the teeth of the user may be engaged.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The tubular member may be formed to extend into the mouth of the wearer, for the purpose of performing fellatio. A penis may be inserted into the tubular member without making direct contact with the lips or mouth or tongue of the wearer. In an alternative form of the invention, the tubular member may extend outwardly from the flanges and the mouth, so that the tongue of the wearer may be extended into the tubular member to perform cunnilingus without making direct contact with the vulva.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The invention also includes an embodiment in which the condom is provided with a progressively expanding diameter from the base to the closed end. The expanded head provides far more comfort and sensation during fellatio.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">In all of the embodiments described, the device may be packaged not only with a lubricating substance but also, or alternatively, with a substance that imparts a pleasant scent and taste to the device, adding further sensual pleasure to oral sexual activity. In addition, the pliant material that forms the condom-like prophylactic may be provided with surface texture and colour to enhance enjoyment during use.<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --></p><heading id="h0002"><u>Brief Description of the Drawing</u></heading><p id="p0013" num="0013"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>Figure 1 is a perspective view of one embodiment of the condom for oral-genital use of the present invention</li><li>Figure 2 is a fragmentary, partially broken away view of the tubular portion of the embodiment of the invention shown in Figure 1.</li><li>Figure 3 is a side elevation of the embodiment of the invention shown in Figures 1 and 2.</li><li>Figure 4 is an end elevation of the embodiment shown in Figures 1-3.</li><li>Figure 5 is a cross-sectional elevation taken along line 5-5 of Figure 4.</li><li>Figure 6 is a cross-sectional elevation similar to Figure 5, depicting a further development of the embodiment of Figures 1-5.</li><li>Figure 7 is a cross-sectional schematic side view of the average human dentition and oral structure.</li><li>Figure 8 is a cross-sectional view as in Figure 7, showing the use of the embodiment of the condom of the present invention for fellatio.<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --></li><li>Figure 9 is a cross-sectional view as in Figure 7, showing the use of a further embodiment of the condom of the present invention for cunnilingus.</li><li>Figure 10 is an end view of the condom of the present invention, as in Figure 4, showing an alternative placement in the mouth.</li><li>Figure 11 is a perspective view of another embodiment of the invention, adapted for particular use in cunnilingus.</li><li>Figure 12 is an end view of the embodiment shown in Figure 11.</li><li>Figure 13 is a side elevation of the embodiment shown in Figures 11 and 12.</li><li>Figure 14 is a perspective view of another embodiment of the invention adapted for fellatio.</li><li>Figure 15 is a cross-sectional view as in Figure 7, showing the use of the embodiment of Figure 14 of the present invention for fellatio.</li><li>Figure 16 is a perspective view of another embodiment of the invention adapted for cunnilingus.</li><li>Figure 17 is a cross-sectional view as in Figure 7, showing the use of the embodiment of Figure 16 of the present invention for cunnilingus.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --></p><heading id="h0003"><u>Description of the Preferred Embodiments</u></heading><p id="p0014" num="0014">The present invention generally comprises a condom designed to permit the practice of oral sex while preventing the transmission of venereal and other contagious diseases through oral-genital contact. With reference to Figures 1-5, one embodiment of the invention comprises a condom 31 which includes a tubular portion 32 having a rounded, dosed end 33 and an opposed open end 34. The length of the tubular portion from the closed end 33 to the opening 34 is generally a few inches, and may be shorter than a typical prior art male condom. The tubular member adjacent to the opening 34 is formed with an oval, ellipsoid cross-section, and the opening end 34 describes a smoothly curved arc, with the arc extending in the same direction as the major axis of the ellipsoidal cross-section, as can been observed by comparing Figures 3 and 4. The tubular portion 32 may be provided with an expanded diameter adjacent to the closed end 33 and extending toward the open end, as shown in Figure 2, to establish a non-constrictive fit with the male member.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">A significant feature of the condom 31 is the provision of a pair of flanges 36 and 37 disposed adjacent to the open end 34. The flanges 36 and 37 are closely spaced apart, and are defined as toroidal surfaces that are generally parallel. Both flanges are ovoid or elliptical when viewed in an end elevation (Figure 4), and flange 36 is slightly smaller in major and minor axis dimensions. The flanges extend in outwardly flaring fashion toward the dosed end 33, and there is defined between the flanges 36 and 37 a channel 38. The flanges 36 and 37 are each provided with a thickened rim 39 and 41,<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> respectively, extending continuously about the distal edge portion of each flange to impart form-retaining characteristics to the flanges. The rims 39 and 41 maintain the open end of the condom and prevent collapse thereof, and maintain the parallel spacing and disposition of the flanges. In an alternative embodiment shown in Figure 6, the distal edges of the flanges 36 and 37 are provided with a pair of O-Rings 42 and 43, respectively, each incorporated into one of the distal edges of one of the flanges. The O-Rings serve the same purposes as the rims 39 and 41.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The condom 31 may be formed of a pliant, thin, elastic, impervious material such as latex rubber, vinyl, or any similar non-toxic, non-allergenic, non-irritative material by multiple dipping processes, molding processes, or the like. With reference to Figure 2, the majority of the tubular portion 32 is rather thin, on the order of 0.051-0.25 mm (0.002-0.010 inch), whereas the end portion 44 of the tubular member adjacent to the open end 34 is thicker. One satisfactory version has an end portion thickness of 0.76 mm (0.030 inch). The end portion 44, which flares slightly to join the flanges 36 and 37, is subject to the most stress and flexure of the assembly, and the thickness of this portion is increased proportionally.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The embodiments depicted in Figures 1-6 are designed to be used as shown in Figures 7 and 8. Figure 7 shows a schematic cross-sectional elevation of the jaw area of a human head, including the upper jaw and teeth 51, the lower jaw and teeth 52, and the tongue 53 in the mouth 54. The condom 31 is applied to the mouth 54, with the dosed end 33 and tubular portion 32 placed into the mouth. The condom 31 is oriented so that the<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> upper and lower lips are engaged in the channel 38, preferably at opposite ends of the major axis of the ellipsoid formed by the opening 34. (Physiological variations may determine that the condom 31 is more easily used when oriented with upper and lower lips aligned with at opposite ends of the minor axis.) The jaws are dosed slightly to squeeze the condom therebetween, deforming the ellipsoid into a more cylindrical shape, or further into a laterally extending ellipsoid, as shown in phantom line in Figure 10.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">The flange 37 is disposed outside of the lips of the condom user, and the flange 36 is disposed between the lips and teeth, as shown in Figure 8. The open end 34 of the condom is directed outwardly to receive a penis for performing fellatio, and the length of the condom limits penetration of the penis to prevent triggering of the gag reflex. Furthermore, there is no interference with the nose of the condom user, so that the user may breathe freely. The condom permits fellatio while preventing skin-to-skin contact between the oral surfaces and the genital surfaces. After use, the condom 31 may be removed by grasping the outer flange 37 and pulling it from the mouth 54.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">A further embodiment of the present invention, shown in Figures 11-13, comprises a condom designed to permit the practice of cunnilingus while preventing skin-to-skin contact between oral and genital surfaces. (Throughout the description of the preferred embodiments, common reference numerals applied to different Figures and embodiments refer to the same structures.) The condom 61 includes a tapered, convex tubular portion<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> 62 having a narrow, rounded dosed end 63 and an open end 64. Joined to the tubular portion 62 adjacent to the open end 64 are a pair of flanges 36 and 37, as described previously, with a channel 38 defined therebetween. The flanges 36 and 37 are substantially the same as described previously, in form and function. The tubular portion 62 is formed of a similar material as described above.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">With regard to Figure 9, the condom 61 is employed by being applied to the mouth 54, with the closed end 63 and tubular portion 62 placed outside the mouth. The condom 61 is oriented so that the upper and lower lips are engaged in the channel 38 at opposite ends of the major axis of the ellipsoid formed by the opening 64. The jaws are dosed slightly to squeeze the condom therebetween, deforming the ellipsoid into a more cylindrical shape, or further into a laterally extending ellipsoid, as shown in phantom line in Figure 10. The flange 37 is disposed outside of the lips of the condom user, and the flange 36 is disposed between the lips and teeth, as shown in Figure 9. The tubular portion 62 extends outwardly, providing a sheath for the extended tongue 53 of the user. The condom 61 permits the user to perform cunnilingus while the tongue 53 , lips, and surrounding area of the user are protected from contact with the vulva of the recipient. After use, the condom is removed by manually grasping the outer flange 37 and disengaging the dentition and lips from the flanges and channel 38.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Another embodiment of the invention, depicted in Figure 14, is similar in many aspects to the embodiment of Figures 1 and 3, and common reference numerals are used to designate common features. This embodiment includes a tubular portion 32 having a rounded, dosed end 33 and an opposed open end 34. The length of the tubular portion from the closed end 33 to the opening 34 is generally a few inches, and may be shorter than a typical prior art male condom. The tubular member adjacent to the opening 34 is formed with an oval, ellipsoid cross-section, and the opening end 34 describes a smoothly curved arc, with the arc extending in the same direction as the major axis of the ellipsoidal cross-section. As described previously, a pair of flanges 36 and 37 are disposed adjacent to the open end 34. The flanges 36 and 37 are closely spaced apart, and are defined as toroidal surfaces that are generally parallel. The flanges extend in outwardly flaring fashion toward the closed end 33, and there is defined between the flanges 36 and 37 a channel 38.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The embodiment of Figure 14 further includes a third flange 101, extending parallel to the flanges 36 and 37 and spaced apart and adjacent to flange 36. The flanges 101 and 36 define therebetween a channel 102 extending about the condom parallel to the channel 38. As depicted in Figure 15, the channel 38 is engaged by the lips of the user, and the channel 102 is disposed to be engaged by the front teeth of the user, providing greater retention of the condom in the oral cavity with less effort by the lips. As noted with regard to Figures 1-3, the condom of Figures 14 and 15 eliminates skin-to-skin contact during fellatio.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">A further embodiment of the invention, depicted in Figure 16, is similar in many aspects to the embodiment of Figures 11-13, and common reference numerals are used to designate common features. This embodiment includes a tapered tubular portion 62 having a narrow, rounded closed end 63 and an open end 64. Joined to the tubular portion 62 adjacent to the open end 64 are a pair of flanges 36 and 37, as described previously, with a channel 38 defined therebetween. The flanges 36 and 37 are substantially the same as described previously, in form and function. The tubular portion 62 is formed of a similar material as described above. Also provided is a third flange 104, extending parallel to the flanges 36 and 37 and disposed adjacent to and spaced apart from the flange 36. The flanges 36 and 104 define therebetween a channel 106 extending about the condom.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">As shown in Figure 17, the condom of Figure 16 is adapted to be applied to the oral cavity, with the upper and lower lips disposed in the channel 38 and the upper and lower front teeth disposed in the channel 106. The portion 62 extends outwardly from the mouth, and provides a sheath within which the tongue may be extended for performing cunnilingus and similar sexual acts. The channel 106 permits greater retention of the condom in the mouth without significant effort by the lips of the user.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">It may be appreciated that all embodiments of the present invention are directed toward facilitating the safe practice of oral sex. To further this goal, any of the embodiments may be packaged together with substances that impart a pleasing flavor and aroma to the condom, so that the use thereof will not be hindered by unpleasant taste or scent. In addition, coloring and<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> surface texture may be added to the condoms to enhance the pleasure of their use.</p>
