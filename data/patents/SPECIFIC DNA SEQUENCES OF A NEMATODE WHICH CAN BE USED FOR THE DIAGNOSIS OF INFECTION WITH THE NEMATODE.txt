In the case of livestock, infections arise at all ages and in virtually every farm.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The use of anthelmintics is widespread in veterinary medicine. In the Netherlands 35 million guilders were spent on anthelmintics in 1987. In 1985 worldwide spending on anthelmintics was US$ 540 million. The total costs of parasitic worm infections in cattle (anthelmintics, loss of production, etc.) are estimated to be 100 to 200 million guilders per year in the Netherlands (thesis by H.W. Ploeger 1988, Agricultural University of Wageningen).</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Little is known about the molecular biology of the mechanism of action of the various control agents. Three groups of broad spectrum anthelmintics are known, each of which have their own mechanism of action. These are<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>i) benzimidazoles, which probably act via binding to tubulin and consequently inhibit transport within the cell and cell division (Lacey, E., 1988, The role of the cytoskeletal protein, tubulin, in the mode of action and mechanism of drug resistance to benzimidazoles, Int. J. Parasitol. <u>18</u>, 885-936).</li><li>ii) levamisole and morantel, ganglion stimulants which lead to paralysis of the parasite, and</li><li>iii) avermectins, which intensify the inhibitory effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In nematodes GABA is the most important neurotransmitter for inhibitory signals from interneurons to motor neurons (Barragry, T., 1984a, Anthelmintics - A review, N.Z. Vet. J. <u>32</u>, 161-164; Barragry, T., 1984b, Anthelmintics- review Part II, N.Z. Vet. J. <u>32</u>, 191-199).</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Of these three, the benzimidazoles are the most widely used.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Using molecular biological techniques, we have studied one of the most harmful gastrointestinal parasites in sheep: <u>Haemonchus contortus</u>. This occurs worldwide, causes haemonchosis and is responsible for losses of 50 million guilders per year in sheepfarming in the Netherlands.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">With a view to effective control of this harmful organism, a sensitive and reliable method for the detection of this worm is indispensable. Parasitic worm infections in sheep are usually mixed infections and a method is therefore needed which is able to differentiate between <u>H. contortus</u> and the other parasitic worms present. The methods which are currently used for the diagnosis of <u>H. contortus</u> are:<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>1) the detection of the specific symptoms of the disease in sheep, and</li><li>2) differentiation of the larval culture from faeces of the sheep.</li></ul></p><p id="p0009" num="0009">A disadvantage of 1) lies in the fact that clinical diagnosis of an infection with parasitic intestinal worms is difficult to make because the symptoms of the disease cannot always be differentiated from those of other diseases or poor nutrition. In the case of <u>H. contortus</u> the external symptoms (inter alia anaemia and oedema) are only detectable when there is a severe degree of infection, whereas damage (loss in weight, wool loss, milk loss) is already caused by an infection without these external symptoms of disease.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">A disadvantage of method (2) lies in the fact that the eggs of various nematodes in the faeces of infected animals appear to be very similar to one another, as a result of which in the case of eggs it is not possible to make a diagnosis of the worm species. For this purpose, a larval culture must first be carried out, which takes about one week. In practice, this method is little used (Janssens, P.G., Vercruysse, J. and Jansen, J., editors: Wormen en wormziekten bij mens en dier (Worms and worm diseases in humans and animals) (1989) Samsom Stafleu, Alphen aan de Rijn/Brussels).</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A new, rapid and species-specific test is therefore needed to be able to diagnose infection with <u>H. contortus</u>. In the case of other nematodes there are a number of tests which are used, such as:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>a) the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and</li><li>b) the dot-blot assay.</li></ul></p><p id="p0012" num="0012">The dot-blot assay is very sensitive and rapidly yields<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> results, such as, for example, in the diagnosis of the human nematode <u>Brugia</u>, which causes filariasis (McReynolds, L.A., deSimone, S.M., Williams, S.A. (1986) Cloning and comparison of repeated DNA sequences from the human filarial parasite <u>Brugia pahangi</u>, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA <u>83</u>, 797-801). In this test, total DNA from the eggs is applied to a nylon membrane and hybridised with the specific DNA probe.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In the case of PCR, specific DNA sequences can be used as primer, by which means a fragment of the specific gene is amplified. This can be rendered visible by analysing the reaction mixture using an agarose gel, or by coupling a (fluorescent) label to the primer (De Bruijn, M.H.L., (1988) Diagnostic DNA amplification: no respite for the elusive parasite, Parasitol. Today, 4:293-295). To date, no <u>Haemmonchus contortus</u> DNA is known which is specific for the species and therefore these tests are not possible for the diagnosis of infection with <u>H. contortus</u>. Surprisingly, it has been found that DNA coding for tubulin is species-specific for <u>H. contortus</u>.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">In Parasitology Today volume 6 no 4 April 1990 Roos M.H. et al describe determining whether populations of <u>Haemonchus</u> <u>contortus</u> are of the benzamidazole sensitive type or resistant genotype and suggest using α and β tubulin nucleic acid.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The present invention relates to use of a DNA sequence of a tubulin gene of <u>H. contortus</u> or a part thereof. The DNA sequence of the tubulin gene or a part thereof comprises the alpha-tubulin gene of <u>H. contortus</u> or a part thereof or the beta-tubulin gene of <u>H. contortus</u> or a part thereof.(In figure 1 the DNA and aminoacid sequence of the α-tubulin clone, determined as described further on in the example are given. The numbering of the aminoacids in the α-tubulin gene is from 395-425) (In figure 2 DNA and amino acid sequence of the β-tubulin clone determined as described further on in the example, are illustrated). The numbering of the DNA bases is given above the DNA sequence, that of the amino acids is given below said sequence. The clone contains the 3' half of the gene and the numbering of the amino acids in the β-tubulin gene is 223-448. The polyadenylation signal (bases 1538-1543) is underlined. The site of the oligonucleotide primers is illustrated with a dashed line above the DNA sequence: β-1, bases 1-19 according to the strand<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> illustrated here; β-2 bases 1311-1331 according to the complementary strand).</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">It was known from study of previously published DNA-sequences of β-tubulin genes of other organisms that β-tubulin genes are strongly conserved [(Cleveland, D.W. and Sullivan, K.F. (1985) Molecular Biology and genetics of tubulin. Ann. Rev. Biochem., 54; 331-365), (Little, M. and Seehaus, T. (1988) Comparative analysis of tubulin sequences. Comp. Biochem. Physiol., 90B; 655-670), (MacRae, T.H. and Langdon, C.M. (1989) Tubulin synthesis, structure and function: what are the relationships?<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> Biochem. Cell Biol., 67; 770-789)].</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">Furthermore, it was apparent from previously published DNA-sequences of a number of nematodes (also of β-tubulin, see Driscoll et al. The Journal of Biology, 1989, volume 109, pages 2993-3003) that the known nematode DNA sequences mostly resemble higher eucaryotic tubulin sequences. Various β-tubulin genes occur in most higher eucaryotes. From what is presently known there appears to be more difference between the different types (genes) of β-tubulin within one animal species than between the same type among different animal species. For example: the degree of conservation between tubulin type β-4 and β-5 of the human is 91,2 %, whereas conservation between type β-4 of the human and type β-4 of the chicken is 99,3 %.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Considering the state of the art as described above it is therefore surprising that DNA of β-tubulin is species specific for <u>H. contortus</u>.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Fragments of a DNA-sequence according to the invention can be used as oligonucleotide probes for specifically determining <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u> especially in mixed infections. Preferably the PCR method is used for this. Probes comprising a part of the sequence according to the invention react specifically with, <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u>, whereby a probe comprising a part of the β-tubulin sequence is especially suited for use in specifically determining <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u> in this manner.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Upon studying the conservation of DNA of tubulin genes it was found that the location of the introns is generally conserved. Introns generally occur in the 5' half of the tubulin gene. In the article of Driscoll et al. already cited it was demonstrated that introns also occur in the 3' half of the 3 β-tubulin genes of the nematode <u>C.</u> <u>elegans</u>. These introns can be distinguished from the introns of the β-tubulin genes of other higher eucaryotes.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">It has now been found that the DNA-sequence of the 3' half of the β-tubulin gene of <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u> also contains introns. The 3' half of β-tubulin of <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u> has been found to contain a lot more introns than the 3' half of β-tubulin of <u>C.</u> <u>elegans</u> and the introns also differ in length from the introns of <u>C.</u> <u>elegans</u>. The location and length of introns in the 3' half of the β-tubulin gene appears not to be conserved in nematodes.</p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Further research of β-tubulin genes of other nematodes further to the above mentioned discovery have revealed that there are other nematodes beside <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u> and <u>C.</u> <u>elegans</u> which also contain non<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> conserved introns in the 3' half of their β-tubulin genes.</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The subject invention is therefore in general directed at the use of a DNA sequence of a specific nematode as oligonucleotide probe, which probe comprises a part of the DNA sequence of the 3' half of a β-tubulin gene, for specifically determining the specific nematode. The subject invention is therefore not restricted to a method for specifically detecting <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u> in which method a DNA sequence is used as oligonucleotide probe comprising a part of the 3' half of the β-tubulin gene of <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u>. The detection of <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u> in this manner serves as an example of a method for the diagnosis of an infection with a certain nematode according to the subject invention.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Another suitable example of a nematode which can specifically be detected using an oligonucleotide probe comprising a part of the DNA sequence of the 3' half of the β-tubulin gene is <u>Trichostrongylus colubriformis.</u></p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The presence of differences in the 3' half of β-tubulin genes of nematodes when compared with eachother made a species specific PCR possible. Parts of a DNA sequence comprising a β-tubulin gene can be used as oligonucleotide probes for specifically detecting a nematode with the aid of the PCR in mixed infections.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">A particular embodiment of the method that has been described above comprises the use of parts of the β-tubulin gene as primers, which primers are conserved in various nematodes, whereby two sequences are selected as primers which are located in such a manner that the DNA sequence which is amplified from the total DNA of the nematode via PCR, the amplification product, has a species specific length per nematode. because the DNA sequence which is located between the primers is species specific. It is preferable to amplify DNA from the DNA sequence comprising a part of the 3' half of the β-tubulin gene, as the DNA sequence of the 3' half has been found to differ in intron length per nematode.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Two β-tubulin oligonucleotides, β-1 and β-2 were made on the basis of a DNA sequence of the β-tubulin gene of <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u> as determined by the inventors and illustrated in figure 2, in order to be able to measure the difference in introns among various nematode species. The oligonucleotides namely contain DNA sequences coding for amino acid sequences supposed to be conserved in β-tubulin genes of all higher eucaryotes. Oligonucleotide β-1 comprises amino acids 1-7 of the β-tubulin gene of <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u> and oligonucleotide β-2 comprises amino<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> acids 198-204. The DNA sequence of β-1 is: 5' ACGGATCTCAACCACCTTG 3' and the sequence of β-2 on the complementary strand is 5' CTGGTACTGCTGGTATTCGGA 3'.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The PCR carried out with these oligonucleotides always gave a positive reaction to the presence of <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u> DNA also in mixed infections. With this PCR a DNA fragment of approximately 1300 bases was generated. This PCR always gave a positive result when <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u> DNA was present and then the fragment of 1300 bases was found with the β-1 and β-2 primers. The PCR always gave a negative reaction when no fragment of 1300 bases was present and no <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u> DNA was present.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The PCR with the β-1 and β-2 primers was also tested on DNA of other prevalent sheep parasites. A positive reaction was also found with <u>Trychostrongylus</u> <u>colubriformis</u> also in mixed infections, however the DNA fragment was smaller approximately 900 bases and clearly discernable from the <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u> fragment.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The PCR with the β-1 and β-2 primers was also tested on DNA of <u>Ostertagia</u> <u>circumcincta</u>, <u>Nippostrongylus</u> <u>brasiliensis</u>, <u>Trichinella spiralis</u> and <u>Trichinella</u> <u>native</u>. No reaction was found not even with so called degenerate primers, which take into account the degenaracy of the genetic code. These were, primers β-7 (albino acids 1-6) with DNA sequence: 5' (CTA)G(GC)(GTAC)GA(CT)(CT)T(GCAT)AA(CT)CA(CT)(CT)T 3' and β-8 (amino acids 199-205) on the complementary strand with DNA sequence: 5' TC(CT)TGGTA(TC)TG(CT)TG(GA)TA(CT)TC 3' (figure 2). The PCR with the β-7 and β-8 primers was positive with DNA of <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u> and <u>T. colubriformis</u> giving the DNA fragments that were described previously.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">As the used primers correspond to a DNA sequence coding for a very conserved region of the β-tubulin molecule it appears probable that the β-tubulin gene(s) of the nematode species leading to a negative result with these primers using PCR contain an intron in the sequence of the primers. This could prevent the primer from binding and could prevent any reaction taking place. A change in the amino acid sequence in the region of the primers could also be a possible explanation for the above mentioned result but does not seem probable considering the conservation of the amino acid sequence in this region.</p><p id="p0032" num="0032">By selecting the primers in a different region of the 3' half of the β-tubulin gene a species specific PCR can also be obtained for the nematodes giving a negative result with the primers β-1, β-2, β-7 and β-8.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">The subject invention is therefore also directed at a method<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> for the diagnosis of a worm infection, with which method the total DNA from the eggs from the nematode is amplified preferably via PCR, which method is characterized in the use of two parts of the coding sequence of the β-tubulin gene which are conserved in various nematodes as primers, which primers are located in the DNA sequence of the β-tubulin gene in such a manner that the amplification product has a species specific length per nematode.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">The beta-tubulin probes comprising the complete 2,2 kb β-tubulin clone of <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u> (pEMBLaB, deposited at the CBS in Baarn under Nr. CBS 335.90) or the 1,3 kb β-1/β-2 PCR fragment always show a positive reaction to the presence of <u>H. contortus</u>, even in the case of a mixed infection. The beta-tubulin probes of <u>H. contortus</u> were also tested on the DNA of other frequently occurring sheep parasites and this reaction was found to be much less pronounced than with its own species. Yet specific bands were obtained with these large probes which indicates conservation. The weaker reaction could be caused by introns in conserved regions or small species specific DNA sequences within these large probes. The species which were tested are, inter alia: <u>Cooperia circumcincta</u>, <u>Nematodirus battus</u>, <u>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</u>, <u>Ostertagia circumcincta</u>, <u>Trichostrongylus colubriformis</u>, <u>Trichostrongylus vitrinus</u>, <u>Trichinella spiralis</u> and <u>Trichinella native</u>.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">By selecting a specific sequence from a DNA sequence according to the invention of for example, at least 10 nucleotides from a <u>H. contortus</u> specific intron or the DNA sequence coding for amino acids 332-335, which under specific conditions reacts solely with <u>H.</u> <u>contortus</u>, it is possible to establish a test by means of which it is possible, in the case of a mixed infection with nematodes, to diagnose infection with <u>H. contortus</u> from the DNA of the eggs.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">Examples of tests which can be used are those which are used in the case of other nematodes:<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>a) the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and</li><li>b) the dot-blot assay.</li></ul></p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The present invention also relates to a method for the diagnosis of a worm infection, in which method the total DNA from the eggs from the nematode is applied to a nylon membrane and hybridised with a DNA probe, which method is characterised in that a diagnosis of infection with <u>Haemonchus contortus</u> is made, using a sequence which corresponds to a specific part of a tubulin gene of <u>H. contortus</u> as oligonucleotide probe. A preferred method is a method in which specific<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> DNA fragments from the DNA of the eggs are amplified, for example by means of PCR, and are rendered visible.
