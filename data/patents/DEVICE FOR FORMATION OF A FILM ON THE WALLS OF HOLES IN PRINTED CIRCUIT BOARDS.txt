EP	0612463	B2	2000-05-24	en	DESCR	1	<p id="p0001" num="0001">The invention concerns a device for formation of a film on the walls of small holes in boards for printed circuits.</p><p id="p0002" num="0002">A device for the formation of such films, according to the preamble of claim 1, is disclosed in EP-A-0 424 798. The circuit boards are immersed in a special bath so that a protective or antioxidizing film, or some film to improve surface quality, may be formed on said boards and especially on the walls of the holes bored through them. The components of said bath determine chemical reactions on the copper surfaces forming what is known as chemical tin or chemical copper or other products.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In mass production methods the boards follow each other through the bath moved along by some means of transport. This is clearly a lengthy process partly because the film deposited must be as uniform as possible.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">The major difficulty arises over forming the film on the walls of the very small holes made in these boards since passage of the liquid through them is hindered by their minute diameters and also because their walls lie orthogonally<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> to the direction in which the boards move especially if this movement is parallel to their greater surfaces.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">While the horizontal disposition of the boards may be optimum from the structural and functional standpoints, it does not facilitate action by gravity of the chemical agents on the sides of the above holes which, as said above, lie orthogonally to the surfaces of the boards.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Purpose of the present invention is to shorten working times and also to ensure the best possible formation of film inside the holes, as will be explained below.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Subject of the invention is a device for forming a film on the walls of small holes bored in printed circuit boards by immersion of said boards in a tank containing a specific liquid product.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">One or more sets of nozzles, orthogonal to board movement, are placed in the tank in a position corresponding to that of the boards, said tank also containing a pump that continually takes up liquid and returns it to the bath under pressure applied through said nozzles.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">In this way currents of liquid are made to flow through said holes.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The chemical reaction between the bath's components and the copper sides of the holes can result in formation of a film of chemical tin, chemical copper or of some other substance, as the case may be.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">A special mechanism causes the boards to move along continuously on a level parallel to their greater surface and to the free surface of the liquid.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Preferably the tank contains sets of 'suction' nozzles through which liquid is taken from the bath, said sets<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> alternating with other sets of pressure nozzles, also orthogonal to movement of the boards and in a position corresponding to that of said boards, through which second responding to that of said boards, through which second set the liquid is returned to the bath.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Entry point of a pump is connected to the suction nozzles and its exit point to the pressure nozzles.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The nozzles of each set are fed on a plane which is orthogonal and transversal to movement of the boards.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In this way currents of liquid, alternating in one direction and in the opposite direction, will pass through the holes and in doing so speed up and improve formation of the desired film.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The nozzles consist of thin rectangular openings, each set being aligned transversally to the direction in which the boards move, the purpose of this being to set up laminar currents transversal to this movement.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In one execution each set of nozzles consists of several longitudinal slit-like mouths, placed along the top of horizontal cylindrical tubes.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">These tubes are parallel, transversal to movement of the boards, some being joined by vertical connections to a longitudinal tube fixed to the entry side of the pump, and others to another tube, parallel to the first one, fixed to the exit side of the pump.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The invention offers some evident advantages. The currents of liquid in the tank flowing in opposite directions and passing back and forth inside the holes in the boards moving along the tank, increase the amount of movement between said liquid and the walls of the holes. This signifies an increase in the speed at which particles of liquid are deposited and in the chemical reactions that give rise to formation of film on the walls of said holes.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Not only does the invention achieve this but it also reduces costs of manufacturing printed circuits and improves their quality.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Characteristics and purposes of the invention will be made still clearer by the example of its execution here following illustrated by diagrammatic figures.</p><heading id="h0001"><u>Examples of execution</u></heading><p id="p0022" num="0022"><dl id="dl0001" compact="compact"><dt>Fig. 1</dt><dd>Perspective view of an apparatus for printed circuits with the device subject of the invention.</dd><dt>Fig. 2</dt><dd>Detailed view of the 'suction' nozzles.</dd><dt>Fig. 3</dt><dd>Detailed view of the pressure nozzles.</dd></dl></p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The device 10 comprises the frame 11 and tank 12 for holding the liquid product 13 that gives a chemical reaction on the boards 20 of printed circuits.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Said boards 20 are made to slide on a horizontal geometrical plane, indicated by XX, by means of two sets of motor-driven wheels 21 and 22 one above and the other below said plane.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">The sets of transversal parallel manifolds 30 and 31, respectively alternated, are placed at established intervals below said plane XX.</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">Aligned on the upper side of said manifolds are the rectangular nozzles, 32 and 33 respectively.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">The manifolds 30 are joined by connections 28 to the longitudinal tube 34 while manifolds 31 are joined by connections 29 to the longitudinal tube 35 parallel to the first one.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The tube 34 is connected to the exit side 36 of the pump 50 while the tube 35 is connected to the entry side 37 of said pump.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">By means of this pump the liquid 13 contained in the tank 12 is continually recycled since it is sucked up through<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> the nozzles 32 and returned through nozzles 33 with the current 40 flowing upward and thus towards the printed circuit boards 20, and the current 41 caused by said boards to flow downward.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">Penetration of said current 40 inside the holes 42 in the printed circuit boards and current 41 flowing out from said holes 42, increases the movement of liquid in relation to the walls of the holes and this in turn increases and potentiates the chemical reaction that leads to gradual formation of the film 43, especially of chemical tin or chemical copper on said walls.</p>
