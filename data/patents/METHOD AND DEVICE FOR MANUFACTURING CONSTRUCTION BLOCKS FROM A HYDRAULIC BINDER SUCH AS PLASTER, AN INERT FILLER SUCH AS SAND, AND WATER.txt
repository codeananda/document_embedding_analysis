EP	0619773	B1	2000-03-15	en	CLAIM	2	<claim id="c-en-01-0001" num="0001"><claim-text>A method for manufacturing blocks from a mixture of a hydraulic binder, such as plaster, an inert filler, such as sand, and water, the hydraulic binder increasing in volume during its hydration and the said mixture being molded under pressure during a period of time that is sufficient for obtaining hydration under pressure of the hydraulic binder and obtaining a densification of its crystal lattice, the method consisting in placing a measured quantity of the mixture in a mold having undeformable side walls (30) and top and bottom horizontal plates (38, 40) that are movable in vertical translation inside the mold with small clearance relative to the side walls, in slowly displacing at least one of the plates in the mold on successive predetermined strokes so as to settle the mixture inside the mold and to impart a predefined height to the block to be obtained by progressively compressing the mixture in the mold, in keeping said plates in place during the above hydration period of the hydraulic binder by resisting its volumic expansion, and then in moving one of the plates away for the purpose of unmolding the block by displacing the other plate towards the inside of the mold.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-01-0002" num="0002"><claim-text>A method according to claim 1, characterized in that it consists in detecting the pressure increase in the mold that results from the hydration of the hydraulic binder for defining the end of the above period and then in unmolding the building block once this pressure has reached a predetermined value.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-01-0003" num="0003"><claim-text>A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that it consists in displacing some<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> of the side walls of the mold over a short distance in an outward direction in order to facilitate unmolding.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-01-0004" num="0004"><claim-text>An apparatus for carrying out of the method according to claims 1, 2 or 3, comprising a mold having undeformable side walls (30) and top and bottom horizontal plates (38, 40) which are movable in translation inside the mold with a small clearance relative to the side walls, means (52, 90) for positioning the bottom plate in the mold, means (54) for filling the mold with a measured quantity of said mixture, means for installing the top plate (38) in the mold, at least one hydraulic press (62) for displacing at least one of the plates (38, 40) inside the mold to settle the mixture inside the mold and to compress it under high pressure until the desired height of the block to be obtained, means for withdrawing at least one of the plates from the mold, and hydraulically actuated unmolding means (80) for extracting the block from the mold, characterized in that the press (62) is controlled for slowly displacing one or both of said plates inside the mold over successive predetermined settling and compressing strokes and in that the device comprises means (70,74,90,92) independent from the press for keeping the plates in place in the mold during the expansion of the hydraulic binder resulting from its hydration.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-01-0005" num="0005"><claim-text>An apparatus according to claim 4, characterized in that it comprises means (76) for detecting a pressure increase of the mixture in the mold that results from the hydration of the hydraulic binder.<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --></claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-01-0006" num="0006"><claim-text>An apparatus according to claim 4, characterized in that the vertical walls of the mold are surrounded by at least one rigid support frame (86) which includes means (88) for transverse displacement of at least two adjacent vertical walls of the mold over a short distance.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-01-0007" num="0007"><claim-text>An apparatus according to any one of claims 4 to 6, characterized in that it comprises at least one station (A) for filling the mold, a station (C) for compressing the mixture inside the mold and an unmolding

characterized in that it also comprises means (84) for grasping and transferring the block extracted from the mold.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-01-0009" num="0009"><claim-text>An apparatus according to any one of claims 4 to 8, characterized in that at least the top plate (138) of the mold includes an oblique rim (44) over at least a fraction of a periphery of its face that comes into contact with the mixture in the mold for forming a chamfer (28) over at least a fraction of a top peripheral edge of the building block.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-01-0010" num="0010"><claim-text>An apparatus according to any one of claims 4 to 9, characterized in that the bottom plate of the mold includes at least one projecting core (46) on its face that comes into contact with the mixture in the mold, the core enabling at least one cavity (18) to be formed in the building block.</claim-text></claim><claim id="c-en-01-0011" num="0011"><claim-text>An apparatus
