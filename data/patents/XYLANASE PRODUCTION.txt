The invention is directed in particular at a recombinant DNA material comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding at least a ripening form of a β-1,4 endoxylanase of fungal origin having bread improving activity, said nucleotide sequence being selected from the group comprising the nucleotide sequence of Figure nr. 1 and equivalent nucleotide sequences such that<ul id="ul0001" list-style="dash" compact="compact"><li>the equivalent nucleotide sequence corresponds either to a nucleotide sequence encoding the amino acid sequence of Figure nr. 1 or to those parts of the amino acid sequence of Figure nr. 1 essential for an active ripening form of β-1,4 endoxylanase with bread improving activity, said ripening form being selected from the group comprising the mature, the pre, pro and prepro form and/or</li><li>the equivalent nucleotide sequence has a complementary strand capable of hybridizing under stringent hybridizing conditions to the nucleotide sequence of Figure nr. 1, said stringent hybridizing conditions being incubation in 6xSSC at 68°C with washing steps at the same temperature with 2x and 0,4xSSC respectively.</li></ul></p><p id="p0002" num="0002">A transformed cell comprising such recombinant DNA material also falls within the scope of the invention. As does such a transformed cell suitable for use in a process in which a cellulose and/or hemicellulose containing raw material is used in a functional manner known per se for the non transformed host cell, said cell becoming polyfunctional for said process upon expression of the recombinant DNA encoding the ripening form of β-1,4 endoxylanase and subsequently secreting at least a mature form of the β-1,4-endoxylanase having bread improving activity, thereby enabling degradation of xylan.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">A β-1,4-endoxylanase having bread improving activity obtainable by expression of the recombinant DNA material according to the invention is also covered. A process for producing a ripening form of β-1,4-endoxylanase comprising an amino acid sequence according to figure 1, sequence id no 7 or 8 comprising culturing a cell according to the invention in a suitable nutrient medium and optionally isolating the resulting enzyme ripening form also forms an embodiment of the invention. Bakery products, flour compositions, bread improver compositions and dough compositions comprising the recombinant DNA material, the cell or the β-1,4-endoxylanase according to the invention are also claimed as part of the invention. The new products also lead to improved processes for preparing a bakery product, and for processing a cellulose containing material to prepare beer, paper, starch, gluten etc., or<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --> to decompose cellulose- and/or hemicellulose containing waste and is directed at a cell having a certain function in a process, containing recombinant DNA encoding at least one enzyme. The invention is directed especially at a cell having a function in the field of food processing and also at cells with a function in processes in which a cellulose-containing raw material is used, such as processes for preparing beer, paper, starch, gluten etc, and processes for decomposing cellulose-containing waste such as agricultural waste, waste from paper mills etc.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In particular the invention is directed at cells having a function in the process of fermentation, more especially at cells with a function in the process of preparing bakery products.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">The cell according to the invention is characterized in that the cell becomes polyfunctional for the process in which it has a function, upon expression of the recombinant DNA encoding at least one enzyme. In the case of a fermentation process for example, such as the preparation of bread, yeast is used as a cell with a particular function in said process. A yeast cell according to the invention does not only have its normal function, i.c. a function that a yeast lacking the recombinant DNA can also carry out, but also has another function in said process of bread preparation. An example of such an additional function is the expression and secretion of a bread improving enzyme.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">The present invention is directed in particular at a cell with a function in the preparation of bakery products. Cells containing recombinant DNA encoding enzymes selected from the group of enzymes with amylolytic and/or hemicellulolytic and/or cellulolytic activity are suitable.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The invention is also directed at a process for the production of at least one enzyme by a polyfunctional cell as described above comprising culturing such a polyfunctional<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> cell in a suitable nutrient medium and optionally isolating the resulting enzyme form. In such a process, said enzyme is preferably selected from the group of enzymes with amylolytic and/or hemicellulolytic and/or cellulolytic activity. A suitable medium for carrying out the process according to the invention can consist of the medium in which the process for which the cell is polyfunctional is carried out. In the process of the preparation of a bakery product for example said medium can be the dough that is to be baked. Naturally the other usual media for culturing cells can also be used. The choice of media will depend on whether the enzyme is to be used in situ or has to be isolated. In some cases it will suffice to use the medium containing said enzyme and in other cases the enzyme will have to be isolated from the medium.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">The invention is also directed at an enzyme encoded by the recombinant DNA in said polyfunctional cell, whereby said enzyme is obtainable from such a polyfunctional cell via the afore mentioned process for producing an enzyme. The invention is further directed at the use of such a polyfunctional cell or such an enzyme, for example in the processes described above, such as food processing and processes using a cellulose containing raw material, preferably in a process for the preparation of a bakery product.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">Flour, yeast, water and salt are the basic ingredients of bread and other bakery products. For centuries materials having a positive effect on the manageability of the dough or the quality of the baked product have been added in the manufacture of bread and similar bakery products, for the sake of convenience further referred to as bread making. Said additives, referred to as "bread improvers", contain enzymes from malt or of microbial origin which play an important part in the different phases of bread making, namely, the preparation of the bread batter, fermentation, baking, and storage of the bread product.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">One of the relevant characteristics of bread that is influenced by adding specific enzymes is the so-called bread volume. In order to obtain a high bread volume in practice compositions containing cellulolytic, hemicellulolytic and/or amylolytic enzymes are added. The commercially available compositions<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> of microbial origin, mostly originating from a fungus of one of the genera <u>Aspergillus</u> and <u>Trichoderma</u>, are substantially unpurified complex mixtures of different enzyme activities, whereby it is not exactly known which enzymes are present in the composition and which have a bread improving activity. This lack of knowledge impedes further bread improvement and especially impedes the control of the different dough processing and bread properties, such as the bread volume.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Further investigation into the process of preparation of bakery products resulted in the discovery that, in addition to α-amylase, at least a xylanase enzyme is also of importance for the bread volume. A xylanase is an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of xylans occurring in the pentosan part of starch "tailings". The term "tailings" is directed at a fraction of, e.g., wheat starch consisting of water-insoluble hemicellulose (pentosans and arabinoxylans) and damaged starch. This fraction is formed as the intermediate or top layer of the starch pellet during centrifugation of a dough suspension obtained by washing dough to remove the gluten fraction.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Different xylanases have already been described in the literature, including xylanases of the bacterial species <u>Bacillus</u> <u>pumilus</u> (Panbangred et al., Mol. Gen. Genet. 192, 335-341, 1983, and Fukusaki et al., FEBS Lett. <u>171</u>, 197-201, 1984), <u>Bacillus</u> <u>subtilis</u> (Paice et al., Arch. Microbiol. <u>144</u>, 201-206, 1986), and <u>Bacillus</u> <u>circulans</u> (Yang et al., Nucl. Acids Res. <u>16</u>, 7187, 1988), of the yeast <u>Aureobasidium</u> (Leathers, Biotech. Lett. <u>10</u>, 775-780, 1988) and of the fungus <u>Aspergillus</u> <u>niger</u> (Fournier et al., Biotechnology and Bioengineering <u>27</u>, 539-546, 1985).</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">It is known from European patent application EP-A-0338452 that the properties of dough and the quality of bread can be improved by adding different enzyme compositions to the dough, including an enzyme composition having hemicellulose degrading or xylanase activity, the origin of which is not further specified. Such a hemicellulolytic enzyme composition is a relatively undefined enzyme mixture which may contain different hemicellulolytic enzymes having various<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> effects on the dough and bread properties. The presence of xylanases having bread improving activity to a smaller or greater extent is the coincidental result of the manner in which the enzyme composition that is intended as a bread improver has been obtained. A controlled further optimization of bread improvers, however, was not possible due to the lack of the required knowledge and of suitable recombinant DNA constructs encoding a xylanase having bread improving activity that could be used for a high production of such a xylanase.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">For the purpose of this invention, "bread improving activity" is generally taken to mean a favourable effect on any property of the prepared bakery product (including bread) or of the dough from which the bakery or bread product is made, and is particularly taken to mean a favourable effect on the bread volume.</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The investigation on which the invention is based has extended to the identification and cloning of a gene (<u>xylA</u>) encoding an enzyme, xylanase having bread improving activity, originating from a fungus of the species <u>Aspergillus</u> <u>niger</u> var. <u>awamori</u>, as well as to the transformation of different species of host cells in such a manner that the gene is expressed or can be expressed in said host cells. The invention comprises recombinant DNA material as defined in the introduction originating from fungi and especially from fungal strains from the same genus and therefore the invention is not limited to the actually cloned gene.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The term "ripening form" refers to the different forms in which the enzyme may occur after expression of the associated gene. More in particular, it refers to both the naturally and the not naturally occurring prepro-, pre- and pro-forms and to the ultimate mature form of the enzyme resulting after cleavage of a "leader" peptide.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">More in particular, the invention, relates to recombinant DNA material comprising DNA with a nucleotide sequence encoding<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> at least a ripening from of a xylanase of <u>Aspergillus</u> origin.</p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Preferably, this aspect of the invention is concerned with recombinant DNA material comprising DNA with a nucleotide sequence encoding a ripening form of a xylanase of <u>Aspergillus</u> <u>niger</u> origin, especially of <u>Aspergillus</u> <u>niger</u> var. <u>awamori</u> origin.</p><p id="p0019" num="0019">A preferred embodiment of this aspect of the invention is recombinant DNA material comprising DNA with a nucleotide sequence encoding at least a ripening form of xylanase with an amino acid sequence as shown in Fig. 1, and more in particular recombinant DNA material comprising DNA with a nucleotide sequence encoding a ripening form of xylanase, as shown in Fig. 1. The invention is also directed at recombinant DNA material comprising DNA with a nucleotide sequence encoding at least a ripening form of xylanase with a nucleotide sequence that is equivalent to the nucleotide sequence of Fig. 1 with deletions, insertions or alterations in comparison to the nucleotide sequence of Fig. 1 such that the nucleotide sequence with deletions, insertions or alterations corresponds either to the amino acid sequence as shown in Fig. 1 or to those parts of the amino acid sequence of Fig. 1 essential for an active ripening form of xylanase such as mature xylanase or active pre(pro) xylanase or the nucleotide sequence with deletions, insertions or alterations has a complementary strand capable of hybridizing under hybridizing conditions to the nucleotide sequence of Fig. 1.</p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The the recombinant DNA according to the invention contains at least a sequence encoding the fungal, in particular the <u>Aspergillus</u> xylanase ripening form. In addition, the recombinant DNA may contain many other types of information, such as regulating sequences (especially a transcription promoter) and a vector part usually provided with one or more marker genes. These other types of information will often be connected with the selected host. Thus, for instance, the vector, the marker genes and the regulating sequences will be selected depending on the selected host.</p><p id="p0021" num="0021">The recombinant DNA encoding at least a ripening xylanase of fungal origin, however, may also contain other genes to be<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> expressed in the selected host.

The invention further extends to both live cells and cells that are no longer alive.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In principle the invention knows no special limitations with respect to the nature of the cells, whereby those cells capable of expression of a xylanase ripening form of fungal origin are preferred.

In connection with bread making the yeast strains that are genetically manipulated in accordance with the present invention can for example be used directly.</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Partly depending on the selected host the gene encoding xylanase will be used, either with or without introns occurring in said gene, either with its own transcription termination signals or originating from another gene, and either with its own leader sequence or with a signal sequence originating from another gene. For transformation of yeast, such as <u>Saccharomyces</u> <u>cerevisiae</u> (baker's yeast), it is preferable that the introns are removed and that the own<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --> leader sequence is replaced by a signal sequence suitable for yeast, such as the signal sequence of the invertase gene, ensuring correct processing and secretion of the mature protein.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The removal of introns is necessary upon transformation of bacteria, such as <u>Bacillus</u> <u>subtilis</u>.

The invention is therefore directed at an amino acid structure leading to a tertiary enzyme structure with the same enzyme activity as the enzyme with the sequence of figure 1.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Yet another aspect of the invention consists of a process for producing a ripening form of a xylanase of a fungus, in particular of <u>Aspergillus</u> origin, comprising culturing a polyfunctional cell capable of expressing a xylanase ripening form and or a cell capable of expressing the recombinant DNA<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --> material according to the invention encoding a ripening form of xylanase of fungal origin in a suitable nutrient medium, and optionally isolating the resulting xylanase ripening form. The tern "isolating the resulting xylanase ripening form" also comprises a partial purification in which an enzyme composition is recovered comprising the relevant xylanase.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Further aspects of the present invention are a bread improver composition comprising an enzyme selected from the group of enzymes with amylolytic and/or hemicellulolytic and/or cellulolytic activity such as a ripening form of xylanase, in particular a mature xylanase of a fungus, especially of <u>Aspergillus</u> origin, whereby said enzyme is obtainable from a polyfunctional cell according to the invention and/or from expression of recombinant DNA according to the invention encoding a ripening form of a xylanase of fungal origin and a bread improver composition comprising a polyfunctional cell according to the invention; a flour and dough composition comprising an enzyme selected from the group of enzymes with amylolytic and/or hemicellulolytic and/or cellulolytic activity such as a ripening form of xylanase, in particular a mature xylanase of a fungus, especially of <u>Aspergillus</u> origin, whereby said enzyme is obtainable from a polyfunctional cell according to the invention and/or from expression of recombinant DNA according to the invention encoding a ripening form of a xylanase of fungal origin; a flour and dough composition comprising a polyfunctional cell according to the invention; a bakery product obtained using such flour or dough compositions as described above; and a process for the preparation of a bakery product, using such flour or dough compositions especially in which a mature xylanase of a fungus, in particular of <u>Aspergillus</u> origin is included.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The invention, however, also extends to other uses of fungal xylanases, such as use within the scope of beer making, particularly the preparation of beers on the basis of wheat, in order to improve filterability, use in the paper-making industry to reduce water absorption by the paper material, use in the treatment of agricultural waste, etc.<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --></p><p id="p0036" num="0036">The invention will now be elucidated by means of an extensive description of the identification, cloning and expression of a xylanase suitable as a bread improver. In the experimental work described in the examples the fungal strain <u>Aspergillus</u> <u>niger</u> var. <u>awamori</u> CBS 115.52 (ATCC 11358) is used as a source for the xylanase. According to investigations carried out by the inventors, said strain, after induction with wheat bran, is capable of producing a xylanase having bread improving properties, while the culture medium exhibits an α-amylase activity, a low glucanase activity and a low protease activity under these induction conditions. The amount of xylanase produced by the wild-type strain, however, is too low for use in a commercial process. For this reason the invention also provides gene manipulations enabling a biotechnological production of the xylanase on a commercial scale.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">The conducted experimental work comprises the isolation of the gene encoding a xylanase enzyme (the <u>xylA</u> gene) from a gene library of chromosomal <u>Aspergillus</u> <u>niger</u> var. <u>awamori</u> DNA made in a λ vector. For said isolation a probe was made with a composition derived from the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified mature protein as determined by the inventors. By means of this probe a number of λ clones were isolated which possibly contained the gene. A DNA fragment from these positive A clones was subcloned. Subsequently, the DNA sequence of part of the cloned chromosomal DNA fragment was determined. By means of these results and those of mRNA analysis, the length of the <u>xylA</u> gene, the length of the mRNA, and the presence and position of an intron have been determined. It could be derived from the data that the <u>xylA</u> gene encodes a protein of 211 amino acids (a pre(pro)-form) in which the mature protein of 184 amino acids is preceded by a "leader" peptide of 27 residues.</p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Three expression vectors containing the xylanase gene including the <u>xylA</u> terminator have been constructed. In one of these vectors the <u>xylA</u> gene is preceded by its own expression signals. In the second vector the <u>xylA</u> expression signals (up to the ATG codon) have been replaced by the constitutive expression signals of the <u>Aspergillus</u> <u>nidulans</u><!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (<u>gpdA</u>) gene (see Punt et al., Gene <u>69</u>, 49-57, 1988), while in the third vector the <u>xylA</u> gene is preceded by the inducible expression signals of the <u>Aspergillus</u> <u>niger</u> var. <u>niger</u> glucoamylase (<u>glaA</u>) gene. All the expression vectors contain the <u>Aspergillus</u> <u>nidulans</u> acetamidase (<u>amdS</u>) gene as selection marker as described by K. Wernars, "DNA mediated transformation of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans", thesis, Landbouw Hogeschool Wageningen 1986.

Variability in the productivities between the different transformants may be the result of differences in copy number and/or of differences in the site of integration into the genome. Of course, the testing conditions may also have a significant effect on the xylanase production. For optimization of the production, however, preference will be given to strains showing a relatively high productivity.</p><heading id="h0026"><u>5 Materials and methods</u></heading><heading id="h0027"><u>5.1 Strains and plasmids</u></heading><p id="p0074" num="0074">In the experiments the following strains and plasmids were used:<ul id="ul0004" list-style="dash" compact="compact"><li><u>Aspergillus</u> <u>niger</u> var. <u>awamori</u> strain CBS 115.52, ATCC11358;</li><li><u>Aspergillus</u> <u>niger</u> var. <u>niger</u> strain N402, a cspA1 (short conidiophores) mutant of <u>Aspergillus</u> <u>niger</u> var. <u>niger</u> ATCC9029, CBS 120.49;</li><li><u>Aspergillus</u> <u>niger</u> var. <u>niger</u> AB4.1, a <u>pyrG</u> mutant of <u>Aspergillus niger</u> var. <u>niger</u> N402, described by Van Hartingsveldt et al., Mol.Gen.Genet. 206, 71-75, 1987;</li><li><u>Escherichia</u> <u>coli</u> strain JM109 (for plasmid isolation, see Yanisch-Perron et al., Gene 33, 103-119, 1985);</li><li><u>Escherichia</u> <u>coli</u> strain NM539 (for construction and amplification of the lambda-gene library);</li><li>plasmid pGW325, containing the <u>amdS</u> gene of <u>Aspergillus nidulans</u> see K.

For this purpose the <u>S</u>. <u>cerevisiae</u> strain must secrete the xylanase under conditions present during the fermentation of wheat dough. In lean wheat dough no sugar is added and therefore the main carbon sources for the fermenting bakers yeast are glucose and maltose. The xylanase gene should therefore be regulated by a promoter which is not affected by glucose repression. Promoters of the genes of the glycolytic pathway (<u>GAPDH</u>, <u>PGK</u>, <u>ADH1</u>, <u>PYK</u>, etc.) of yeast are extremely useful for this purpose. Just by way of example the promoter of the phosphoglycerate kinase (<u>PGK</u>) gene of <u>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</u> was used. This promoter is used for the expression by <u>S</u>. <u>cerevisiae</u> of numerous heterologous proteins, for example the production of human interferon-alpha (Tuite et al., 1982).<!-- EPO <DP n="48"> --></p><p id="p0108" num="0108">The preferred way to achieve the expression of an enzyme during bread making is to use an integrative vector (single-copy or multi-copy integration), although autonomously replicating vectors can also be used.</p><p id="p0109" num="0109">The <u>GAL7</u> promoter from the pUR2921 plasmid, used for the expression of the <u>Aspergillus</u> <u>niger</u> var. <u>awamori</u> xylanase in <u>Saccharomyces</u> <u>cerevisiae</u> (see example III), was replaced by the <u>PGK</u> promoter. <u>S</u>. <u>cerevisiae</u> strains transformed with this new vector, and which secretes the xylanase enzyme in culture media containing glucose, could be used in bread making.

Another way of creating suitable restriction sites at the end of a DNA molecule is by way of an <u>in</u> <u>vitro</u> amplification technique of DNA known as Polymerase Chain Reaction.

After 2 minutes of incubation at 95°C, 25 cycles of the following temperature steps were carried out: 1 min at 95°C, 1:45 min at 52°C, 2 min at 72°C. After these cycles the reaction mixture was maintained at 72°C for 5 min before cooling to 4°C. All temperature cycles were performed in a Perkin Elmer DNA Thermal Cycler. 60 µl was precipitated from the reaction mixture with ethanol and subsequently the band of approximately 600 bp was isolated from agarose gel.

The oligonucleotides BAK51 and BAK53 were not phosphorylated to prevent self-ligation of the resulting fragment, and the fragment was subsequently isolated from agarose gel. The fragment BAK5 measures 169 bp and comprises the invertase signal sequence and the mature xylanase gene up to the <u>Xho</u>I site for a correct fusion to fragment BAK1 (see example III).

A yeast with a high gassing power is therefore required to obtain the full benefit of the addition of the xylanase enzyme. As the SU50 strain is a laboratory strain, it does not possess good gassing properties.
