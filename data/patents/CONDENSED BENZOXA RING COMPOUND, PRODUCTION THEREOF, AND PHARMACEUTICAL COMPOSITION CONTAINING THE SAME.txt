Furthermore, the present invention relates to a process for producing the above-mentioned compound and a novel compound belonging to the category of the above-mentioned compound.</p><heading id="h0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p0002" num="0002">As is well known in the art, atherosclerosis is a very important factor causative of various cardiovascular diseases, and extensive and intensive studies have been conducted with a view to suppression of the progress of atherosclerosis or regression of atherosclerosis. In particular, the efficacy of a drug for lowering cholesterol in the serum or arterial wall is recognized. However, an ideal drug having a significant clinical effect and less liable to occurrence of an adverse effect has not been realized in the art.</p><p id="p0003" num="0003">In recent years, it has become apparent that the accumulation of a cholesterol ester in an arterial wall is an important factor causative of the progress of atherosclerosis. Therefore, a lowering in the cholesterol level in the blood is useful for suppression of the progress of atherosclerosis and regression of the atherosclerosis.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Cholesterol in foods is esterified in tunica mucosa intestini tenuis and then incorporated as chylomicron in the blood. It is known that ACAT plays an important role in the formation of a cholesterol ester in the tunica mucosa intestini tenuis or arterial wall. Therefore, it is considered that the inhibition of ACAT in the tunica mucosa intestini tenuis and the prevention of the esterification can prevent the absorption of the cholesterol, and the cholesterol level of the blood can be lowered.</p><p id="p0005" num="0005">In the arterial wall, the cholesterol is accumulated as a cholesterol ester. Therefore, it is expected that the inhibition of ACAT in the arterial wall can effectively prevent the accumulation of the cholesterol ester.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Thus, an ACAT inhibitor is considered likely to become a drug useful for treating hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis through the prevention of the cholesterol in intestinum tenue and the accumulation of the cholesterol in the arterial wall.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">For example, urea derivatives (see, for example, J. Med. Chem., vol. 29, 1131 (1986) and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) Nos. 63-316761 and 1-93569) and amide derivatives (see, for example, Japanese Examined Patent Publication (Kokoku) No. 63-54718 and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 63-253060) have hitherto been reported as the above-mentioned ACAT enzyme inhibitor. In all the above-mentioned compounds, although the aromatic nucleus is bonded to a nitrogen atom of a urea or amide portion directly or through an alkylene group, no compound is disclosed wherein a benzoxazole condensed ring, that is, benzoxazole or 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran ring, is directly bonded to a nitrogen atom of the urea or amide portion.<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --></p><p id="p0008" num="0008">EP 0 297 610 discloses N-[(2,6-disubstituted)phenyl)]-urea and carbamate inhibitors of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyl-transferase.

Examples of the latter compound known in the art include compounds for use as a herbicide, wherein a chloroacetamide group is bonded to the benzene ring (see Japanese Patent Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 60-109585); compounds for use as a bacteriocide for agriculture and gardening, wherein a substituted phenylamide group is bonded to the benzene ring (see Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 60-215680); compounds for use as a starting compound for a pigment, wherein an acetylacetamide group is bonded to the benzene ring (see Japanese Examined Patent Publication (Kokoku) No. 47-7715); compounds for use as a herbicide, wherein a substituted aryloxyisopropylamide group is bonded to the benzene ring (see Japanese Unexamined PCT Patent<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> Publication (Kohyo) No. 61-501991); compounds for use as an antiallergic drug, wherein a tetrazole group is located as an indispensable group at the 2-position and a substituted phenylamide group is bonded to the benzene ring (see Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 2-138242); compounds for use as an analgesic, wherein an acetamide group is bonded to the benzene ring (see Spanish Patent No. 512355); compounds for use as a herbicide, wherein a methyl or cyclopropyl group is bonded to one nitrogen atom of a ureylene group bonded to the benzene ring (see Canadian Patent No. 117860); and compounds for use as a photosensitive material for silver halide color photography, wherein a substituted alkylamide group or a substituted phenylamide group is bonded to the benzene ring (see Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) Nos. 61-250642 and 61-233742).
