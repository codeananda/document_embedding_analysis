Binding of gallium to transferrins, particularly lactoferrin, is thought to be responsible for some of the transport of gallium in the body, and for the concentration of gallium in certain tumors and inflamed tissues. Radioactive <sup>67</sup>Ga citrate compositions are used in patients to diagnose certain malignancies and infections, including those in bone tissue. Non-radioactive gallium compositions, and compositions containing other Group IIIa elements, have been found effective in treating some tumors in animals and humans. Gallium is thought to be the most effective of these Group IIIa elements<sup>1,3,4</sup>. The art recognizes that gallium is useful for the treatment and prevention of many human and other mammalian diseases, including hypercalcemia, cancer, and certain degenerative or metabolic bone diseases such as osteoporosis and Paget's disease<sup>2-6,13</sup>. Gallium itself appears to be the active agent; the form in which the gallium is administered (e.g. as the nitrate, sulfate, or chloride) does not appear to affect its activity to any significant extent<sup>3,6</sup>.</p><p id="p0004" num="0004">Gallium is particularly useful in the treatment and prevention of hypercalcemia and certain bone diseases. Treatable bone diseases include such widespread conditions as osteoporosis, osteopenia, Paget's disease, malignant bone disease, bone degeneration due to hyperparathyroidism, and other conditions associated with increased bone resorption or turnover in humans or animals<sup>4,6</sup>. In addition to the above, it has been found that gallium increases calcium accretion in bone and decreases bone resorption<sup>5</sup>.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p><p id="p0005" num="0005">Specifically, Warrell et al.<sup>4,6</sup> and Bockman et al.<sup>5</sup> disclose treatments using gallium salts, preferably gallium nitrate, for regulating the resorption of calcium from bone in certain bane diseases and hypercalcemia, and for increasing the mass and tensile strength of bone. Warrell et al.<sup>4</sup> discloses that such regulation entails the generation of plasma gallium concentrations in the patient of from about 0.9 to 2.0 µg/ml whereas Bockman et al.<sup>5</sup> recite the generation of plasma gallium concentrations in the patient of from about 0.1 to 5.0 µg/ml.</p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Treatment of cancer with gallium nitrate is disclosed by Foster et al.<sup>13</sup> which teaches the administration (by infusion) of gallium nitrate at 700-750 mg/m<sup>2</sup> by short infusion every 2-3 weeks; 300 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day by short infusion for three consecutive days, to be repeated every 2 weeks; and 300 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day by continuous infusion for 7 consecutive days, to be repeated every 3-5 weeks. Specific cancers treated in this reference include, by way of example, refractory lymphomas, small cell lung carcinoma, genitourinary malignancies (renal, bladder, prostate, testicular), and multiple myeloma.</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">On the other hand, Collery<sup>2</sup> discloses the treatment of cancer by the oral administration of a dose of from 200 mg to 1 gram of gallium chloride per day for at least 2 months.</p><p id="p0008" num="0008">However, in spite of its established utility, the use of gallium in the treatment of such diseases is hampered by the fact that ionic gallium lacks high bioavailability when delivered orally. In fact, ionic gallium is a form of gallium which is poorly absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. In this regard, Warrell et al.<sup>4</sup> disclose that when a composition of gallium nitrate is administered orally to a dog, only 0.5 to 2% of the gallium is absorbed from the gastrointestinal<!-- EPO <DP n="5"> --> tract, into the bloodstream and then excreted into the urine. The percent absorption of other Ga<sup>+3</sup> salts is not likely to be significantly different, as such salts dissociate in aqueous solutions to produce mainly trivalent gallium ions in a similar manner to gallium nitrate.</p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The low bioavailability of orally delivered gallium salts (i.e., ionic gallium) and the need to generate blood plasma gallium concentrations in the patient of from 0.1 to 5 µg/ml of plasma gallium concentration (and preferably 0.5 to 2 µg/ml) for the treatment of hypercalcemia or excessive bone resorption<sup>5</sup> requires that either impractically large doses of orally delivered gallium be administered to the patient or that the gallium be administered via non-oral means (e.g., intravenous delivery). The oral delivery of such gallium salts is not believed to be practical particularly with widespread, chronic conditions such as osteoporosis and the like.</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The present invention is directed to the discovery that gallium bioavailability via oral administration is greatly enhanced by using electrostatically neutral gallium chelates of certain 3-hydroxy-4-pyrones. The present invention is directed to the further discoveries that because such neutral gallium chelates decompose in the acidic conditions commonly present in the stomach, pharmaceutical compositions of orally delivered neutral gallium chelates must contain means to inhibit dissociation of the neutral gallium chelates under such acidic conditions.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">In regard to the above, it is noted that Finnegan et al.<sup>15</sup> disclose the preparation of aluminum and gallium complexes of some 3-hydroxy-4-pyrones, including maltol. This reference recites that the aluminum maltol complex is highly neurotoxic when injected intracranially into rabbits, and suggests<!-- EPO <DP n="6"> --> further neurotoxicity experiments with the aluminum and gallium complexes. This reference further recites nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) experiments that demonstrated significant differences between the aqueous behavior of the complexes of aluminum and gallium, i.e., experiments to determine the stability of gallium complexes as a function of pH could not be performed, whereas such experiments were readily performed on aluminum complexes.</p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Further regarding the significant differences between aluminum and gallium, aluminum is well known in the art to be a cause of degenerative bone disease<sup>17</sup> as well as being neurotoxic. Contrarily and as previously discussed, gallium is known in the art as effective in the treatment of degenerative bone disease and has shown no reported evidence of neurotoxicity.</p><p id="p0013" num="0013">Farrar et al.<sup>16</sup> disclose the preparation of an aqueous solution containing 10 mM maltol, 1 mM Ga(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, and a trace of GaCl<sub>3</sub> labelled with radioactive <sup>67</sup>Ga for administration to rats by oral gavage. However, it is not established in this reference that this solution contains a significant amount of the neutral 3:1 complex. In any event, Farrar et al. completely fail to even consider the possibility that pH might affect the stability of a Ga-maltol complex. This reference also completely fails to realize, suggest, or imply any method to increase gallium absorption in fed animals. Additionally, this reference fails to suggest combining such gallium complexes with means to inhibit dissociation of the complex in a mammalian stomach.</p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Lastly, Hider et al.<sup>14</sup> disclose orally deliverable pharmaceutical compositions containing neutral iron complexes of 3-hydroxy-4-pyrones and means to inhibit dissociation of such complexes under acidic conditions. However, the teachings of this reference are expressly limited to iron and it is art recognized that gallium<!-- EPO <DP n="7"> --> is not equivalent to iron. Further in this regard, iron is a Group VIII metal that is easily oxidized and reduced between its +2 and +3 valences at physiologic conditions, whereas gallium is a Group IIIa semi-metal be that exists only with a +3 valence state at physiologic conditions.</p><heading id="h0005"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0015" num="0015">In view of the above, the present invention is directed to methods for increasing the bioavailability of gallium into the bloodstream as well as to pharmaceutical compositions employed to achieve such methods.</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Particularly, a primary object of the present invention is to provide the pharmaceutical composition defined in the appended claims.</p><p id="p0017" num="0017">In one of its aspects the present invention is directed to a composition for administering gallium to a mammalian patient (e.g., human patient) which comprises the oral ingestion of a sufficient amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>(a) a neutral 3:1 gallium complex of a 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone wherein said 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone has the formula<chemistry id="chem0001" num="0001"><img id="ib0001" file="imgb0001.tif" wi="51" he="35" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry> wherein each R is independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and alkyl of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms; and</li><li>(b) means to inhibit dissociation of said complex under acidic conditions of the gastro portion of said gastrointestinal tract<br/>so as to provide a blood plasma gallium concentration of from about 0.1 to about 5 µg/ml.</li></ul><!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --></p><p id="p0018" num="0018">In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition for increasing calcium accretion in bone or for decreasing calcium resorption in a mammal (e.g., a human) comprising<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>(a) a neutral 3:1 gallium complex of a 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone wherein said 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone has the formula<chemistry id="chem0002" num="0002"><img id="ib0002" file="imgb0002.tif" wi="52" he="34" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry> wherein each R is independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, and alkyl of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms; and</li><li>(b) means to inhibit dissociation of said complex under acidic conditions of the gastro portion of the gastrointestinal tract.</li></ul></p><p id="p0019" num="0019">Such a composition can be in a solid dosage form for oral administration.<!-- EPO <DP n="9"> --></p><p id="p0020" num="0020">The compositions of this invention are useful for orally delivering gallium to humans and other mammals for a wide variety of medical and veterinary applications, including, by way of example, the treatment of bone diseases relating to the increased resorption of calcium into the bloodstream.<!-- EPO <DP n="10"> --></p><heading id="h0006"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id="p0021" num="0021">As noted above, the present invention is directed to methods and compositions for enhancing the bioavailability of gallium from orally delivered pharmaceutical compositions containing gallium. However, prior to discussing this invention in further detail, the following terms will first be defined. Unless defined below, the terms used herein have their normally accepted meanings.</p><heading id="h0007">1. <u>Definitions</u></heading><p id="p0022" num="0022">As used herein, the following terms have the definitions given below:</p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The term "neutral 3:1 gallium complex of a 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone" refers to an electrostatically neutral complex of Ga<sup>+3</sup> and 3 equivalents of the anionic form of 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone which complex is represented by the formula [Ga<sup>+3</sup>(py<sup>-1</sup>)<sub>3</sub>] wherein py<sup>-1</sup> represents the anionic form of 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone which is defined below. Because such complexes do not dissociate to any significant extent in aqueous solutions maintained at a pH of from about 5 to about 9, these complexes remain predominantly electrostatically neutral in such solutions.</p><p id="p0024" num="0024">In this regard, these complexes are deemed "electrostatically neutral" because there are equal numbers of positive and negative charges in the complex.</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">Also, it is apparent that the anionic form of the 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone acts as a chelating agent to the gallium and as such, the complex is sometimes referred to herein as "neutral gallium chelates of 3-hydroxy-4-pyrones". It being understood that this latter term is<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> synonymous with the term "neutral 3:1 gallium complex of a 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone".</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The term "a 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone" refers to a compound of the Formula 1:<chemistry id="chem0003" num="0003"><img id="ib0003" file="imgb0003.tif" wi="83" he="33" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry> wherein each R is independently selected from hydrogen atoms and alkyl of from one to six carbon atoms.</p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Specific compounds encompassed by the term "a 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone" are represented by the Formulas 2-5 below:<chemistry id="chem0004" num="0004"><img id="ib0004" file="imgb0004.tif" wi="144" he="69" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry> where in each R' is independently alkyl of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms.</p><p id="p0028" num="0028">The unsubstituted form of 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone (Formula 2, also called pyromeconic acid) contains three hydrogen atoms that are bound only to ring carbon atoms.<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> The locations of a few possible substitutions are presented in Formulas 3-5, in which R' is an alkyl group (including methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, and n-propyl). The groups are preferably acyclic and are preferably unbranched. Groups containing six or fewer carbon atoms, particularly of one through three carbon atoms, especially methyl or ethyl, are preferred. Single substitution is preferred; a substitution at either the 6-position or especially the 2-position is preferred. Some examples of specific compounds whose gallium complexes may be used in compositions comprised by the invention are: 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4-pyrone (Formula 3, R' = CH<sub>3</sub> -- sometimes referred to as maltol or larixinic acid) and 3-hydroxy-2-ethyl-4-pyrone (Formula 3, R' = C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub> -- sometimes referred to as ethyl maltol or ethylpyromeconic acid), both of which are preferred for use in this invention, especially 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4-pyrone. Other preferred compounds include 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone (Formula 2 -- sometimes referred to as pyromeconic acid); and 3-hydroxy-6-methyl-4-pyrone (Formula 4, R' = CH<sub>3</sub>).</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">The term "an anion of a 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone" refers to a compound defined in Formulas 2-5 above wherein the hydroxyl proton has been removed so as to provide for the anionically charged form of these compounds.</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The terms "oral administration" and "oral ingestion" refer to all conventional forms for the oral delivery of a pharmaceutical composition to a patient (e.g., human) and that result in the deposition of the pharmaceutical composition into the gastrointestinal tract (including the gastro portion of the gastrointestinal tract, i.e., the stomach) of the patient. Accordingly, oral administration and oral<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> --> ingestion include, by way of example, actual ingestion of a solid or liquid pharmaceutical composition, oral gavage, and the like.</p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The term "inhibit dissociation" means that at least 20%, preferably at least 50% and more preferably at least 80%, of the complex is not dissociated under acidic conditions (e.g., about pH 2-4) for a period of at least 1 hr and preferably at least 3 hours.</p><heading id="h0008">2. <u>Synthesis and Methodology</u></heading><p id="p0032" num="0032">This invention includes methods for the preparation of neutral 3:1 gallium complexes of 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone or 3-hydroxy-4-pyrones of formula 1. Such methods comprise reacting such hydroxypyrones with gallium ions and isolating, at least in part, the resulting complex or complexes.</p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Specifically, the neutral 3:1 gallium complex of a 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone is prepared by the reaction of gallium ions and the 3-hydroxy-4-pyrones in solution. Gallium ions can be derived from a gallium salt, such as a gallium halide, particularly gallium chloride, or a gallium nitrate compound, especially a hydrated gallium nitrate. The gallium nitrate compounds are often preferable as they are easier to work with than gallium halides, which may be highly irritating and may react violently with many solvents, including water. Using the proper safeguards, a variety of gallium salts can be used. The reaction is conveniently effected in a mutual solvent, including but not limited to mixtures containing water, ethanol, methanol, and, chloroform. Pure water may be used in many cases, though the purification of the gallium hydroxypyrone complexes may<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --> be difficult if it is used. A preferable method, if it is desired to separate at least a major part of reaction by-products such as sodium nitrates, sodium chloride, and sodium carbonates, is to use a mixture containing roughly equal parts of ethanol and chloroform, with a trace of water. The reaction by-products mentioned above have very low solubilities in this mixture and can be removed readily by filtration.</p><p id="p0034" num="0034">To produce the preferred neutral 3:1 hydroxypyrone:gallium complex, the hydroxypyrone and the gallium ions are mixed in 3:1 molar proportions, preferably with a slight excess of hydroxypyrone to insure a great preponderance of the 3:1 complex over the 2:1 and 1:1 complexes. The proportions of the particular complexes formed are dependent upon the pH of the solution. When a gallium salt such as a halide or nitrate is dissolved, the resulting solution will generally have a low pH. To form a preponderance of the preferred neutral 3:1 complex, a pH of from 5 to 9, preferably 7 through 8, is used. If a more acidic solution is used, a preponderance of the less preferred 2:1 and 1:1 complexes may instead be formed, even if a large excess of hydroxypyrone is present. Under highly basic conditions, poorly soluble gallium hydroxides may precipitate. It is preferable to regulate the pH with materials other than hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide, as the use of such hydroxides may cause the precipitation of poorly soluble gallium hydroxides, which are not wanted, and the pH may actually be buffered at a low level by this precipitation. The use of a carbonate, especially sodium carbonate, is preferred to regulate the pH. The use of sodium carbonate in a solvent mixture containing ethanol and chloroform, for example, can result in the precipitation of sodium nitrates that are very slightly soluble in this mixture, and which can be filtered off<!-- EPO <DP n="15"> --> if desired to help purify the solution containing the desired pharmaceutical compositions.</p><p id="p0035" num="0035">The reaction to form the hydroxypyrone-gallium complex in solution is generally complete within about five minutes at about 20°C. Gentle stirring or other agitation of the solution promotes a uniform, rapid reaction. Longer reaction times may be used if found necessary. Following the separation, if desired, of reaction by-products such as sodium nitrates, sodium chloride, and sodium carbonates (depending on the solvents and reactants used), the reaction mixture may be evaporated slowly in air or, more rapidly, through the use of a rotary evaporator or by freeze drying, as examples. After drying, the gallium complex or complexes will remain in solid form. Recrystallization can be accomplished, if desired, using a suitable solvent, including but not limited to chloroform, alcohols such as ethanol and methanol, ether, water, acetone, and mixtures containing such solvents. Suitable solvents will depend upon which particular gallium complex(es) and impurities are present, upon the impurities to be separated, and upon the temperature and other physical conditions.</p><p id="p0036" num="0036">It is noted that the mentioned methods are not the only ones that can produce hydroxypyrones and gallium complexes with hydroxypyrones and that various alternative methods may be used as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Additionally, in preparing the neutral 3:1 complexes of gallium with 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone, a single 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone or a mixture of 3-hydroxy-4-pyrones can be used. However, preferably, only a single 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone is employed.</p><p id="p0037" num="0037">With regard to the preparation of 3-hydroxy-4-pyrones which are used as starting materials in the preparation of the neutral 3:1 complexes of gallium with 3-hydroxy-4-pyrones, certain of these compounds<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --> occur naturally and may be obtained by extraction from the natural sources. For example, maltol is found in the bark of the young larch tree (<i>Larix decidua</i> Mill.), and in pine needles, chicory, wood tars and oils, and roasted malt<sup>12</sup>. Certain of the 3-hydroxy-4-pyrones are available commercially, including maltol and ethyl maltol. Others can be made from pyromeconic acid as a starting material, which can be derived from the decarboxylation of meconic acid. Methods for preparing such other 3-hydroxy-4-pyrones are well known in the art. Additionally, it is noted that maltol and ethyl maltol are in widespread use as flavoring and fragrance-enhancing agents for foods, and have very low toxicities when taken orally.</p><heading id="h0009">3. <u>Pharmaceutical Compositions</u></heading><p id="p0038" num="0038">The methods of this invention are achieved by using a pharmaceutical composition comprising a neutral 3:1 complex of gallium with 3-hydroxy-4-pyrone and means to inhibit dissociation of said complex under acidic conditions in the gastro (stomach) portion of the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p id="p0039" num="0039">As noted above, this invention is directed in part to the discovery that while the neutral 3:1 complex of gallium with 3-hydroxy-4-pyrones delivers gallium to the bloodstream from the gastrointestinal tract, this complex will dissociate under acidic conditions (generally at a pH of about 4 or less) such as those which can be present in the stomach to the less absorbable 2:1 and 1:1 complexes, together with free hydroxypyrone and ionic gallium. Accordingly, in order to maintain the orally delivered gallium in a form which is highly absorbable in the gastrointestinal tract, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention are formulated to contain a means to inhibit<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> dissociation of this complex when exposed to the acidic conditions of the stomach.</p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Means to inhibit or prevent dissociation of this complex when exposed to the acidic conditions of the stomach include the following preferred methods:<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>(1) Addition of a sufficient amount of a pharmaceutically compatible buffering agent to the 3:1 complex that would bring the pH of the stomach fluids to a range of from about 5-9 and preferably from about 6-7 so that the stomach fluids would no longer disrupt the 3:1 hydroxypyrone:Ga complex. <br/>Pharmaceutically compatible buffering agents are those which, while acting as a buffering agent, do not significantly alter the ability of the neutral 3:1 gallium complex to deliver gallium to the bloodstream of the patient and are not toxic either alone or in combination with the neutral gallium complex. The particular pharmaceutically compatible buffering agent employed is not critical. Examples of preferred pharmaceutically compatible buffering agents include, by way of example, calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) and the like. On the other hand, aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>, and other aluminum-containing compounds, by way of example, should be avoided. Other pharmaceutically compatible buffering agents are well known in the art and are recited in standard pharmaceutical manufacturing textbooks (e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences by Mack Publishing Company).</li><li>(2) Adding to the pharmaceutical composition containing the 3:1 complex an excess of free hydroxypyrone (or a salt thereof containing a physiologically acceptable cation), particularly the one used to make the 3:1 complex. Such a mixture, when dissolved in the stomach, has the effect of shifting<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> the equilibrium among the 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1 complexes towards a preponderance of the 3:1 complex. In this embodiment, the weight of the free hydroxypyrone incorporated into the formulation is preferably 0.1 to 100 times the weight of the 3:1 complex employed in the formulation, and more preferably 0.1 to 10 times. This method, by itself, is not highly preferred but may be used in conjunction with other methods to inhibit dissociation.</li><li>(3) Formulating the pharmaceutical composition that contains the 3:1 complex in delayed release form, so that a preponderance of the complex is not released until the intestinal tract is reached. An example of such a composition is to formulate the 3:1 complex with certain gels, preferably hydrogels such as a polymerized polyethylene glycol hydrogel, that adsorb the 3:1 complex and then release it after ingestion only very slowly while in the stomach. The preparation of such delayed release formulations, particularly those using hydrogels, is well known in the art.</li><li>(4) Most preferably, formulating or packaging the 3:1 complex in such a way that the release of the 3:1 complex is prevented or inhibited until the basic, or less acidic, conditions of the intestinal tract are reached. Specific preferred methods include:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li>(a) Encapsulating the 3:1 complex in a material that is resistant to dissolution until the intestinal tract is reached, most preferably using a tablet or capsule that is enteric coated, or granules that are enteric coated, to inhibit or prevent release of the 3:1 complex until a pH greater than about 5 or 6 is reached. Enteric coating of tablets, capsules, and granules is well known in the art.</li><li>(b) Microencapsulating the 3:1 complex within liposomes, preferably made from phospholipids, that do not dissociate under the acidic conditions of the<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> stomach, but that will release the 3:1 complex in the higher pH conditions of the intestinal tract. Such liposomes are also well known in the art.</li></ul></li></ul></p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The most preferred method, enteric coating tablets, granules or especially capsules, is well known in the art. Such methods are described, for example, by Porter<sup>7</sup>, by Nagai et al.<sup>8</sup>, by Jones<sup>9</sup>, by Messora<sup>10</sup>, and by Porter<sup>11</sup>. Preferred materials for the enteric coating include, by way of example, cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, poly(vinyl acetate phthalate), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinates, poly(meth)acrylates, and, preferably, cellulose acetate phthalate/diethylphthalate. When capsules are coated, a plasticizer should be used (such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinates/triethyl citrate or especially cellulose acetate phthalate/diethylphthalate) to minimize brittleness in the coating and to inhibit cracking of the coating.

Such enhanced delivery of gallium by pharmaceutical compositions containing neutral 3:1 gallium complexes permit the use of less gallium per unit dose as compared to pharmaceutical compositions containing gallium salts while still providing efficacious blood plasma gallium concentrations. The use of less gallium while still achieving the requisite blood plasma gallium concentrations by the compositions of this invention provides a practical method for the oral delivery of gallium.

In this test, the complex was given to rabbits and compared to a solution of gallium nitrate. Six female New Zealand white rabbits weighing between 2.68 and 2.91 kg were used, and were not fed for 18 hours before starting the experiment. A suspension of the 3:1 gallium ethyl maltol complex in double distilled water was prepared with a concentration of 10 mg elemental gallium per 4 ml of suspension. A solution of gallium nitrate nonohydrate dissolved in double distilled water<!-- EPO <DP n="25"> --> was also prepared, which had a concentration of 10 mg elemental gallium per 4 ml of solution. A small amount of solid sodium carbonate was added to the latter solution to bring the pH up to about 6. Each of the two solutions was given to three rabbits by oral gavage (through a tube inserted through the mouth to the stomach) in the amount of 4 ml per kg of body weight. The stomach tubes were flushed by three ml of water following administration of the solutions.</p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Six ml of blood was taken from each rabbit at 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, and 24 hours following administration of the solutions, and the serum separated and frozen. Control samples of blood were taken 24 hours earlier. The frozen serum samples were then sent to an independent testing laboratory for determination of the gallium contents by graphite furnace atomic absorption analysis. The testing laboratory received numbered serum samples, and never had any knowledge of the experimental conditions used to produce the samples. The results of the analyses are indicated in Table 1. Due to uncertainties in the analytical procedures for gallium in serum, the relative proportions of gallium in the serum samples are considered more significant than the actual reported concentrations.</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">It is seen from Table 1 that the gallium ethyl maltol suspension was absorbed in significantly higher amounts than the gallium nitrate suspension of equal volume and gallium concentration. It is important to note that no attempt was made to counteract the adverse effects of the 3:1 gallium ethyl maltol complex being exposed to the acidic conditions of the stomach. This study should therefore be considered to give a minimal value for the oral bioavailability of the gallium ethyl maltol complex compared to gallium nitrate.<!-- EPO <DP n="26"> --> <tables id="tabl0001" num="0001"><table frame="all"><title>Table 1</title><tgroup cols="3" colsep="1" rowsep="0"><colspec colnum="1" colname="col1" colwidth="52.50mm"/><colspec colnum="2" colname="col2" colwidth="52.50mm"/><colspec colnum="3" colname="col3" colwidth="52.50mm"/><thead valign="top"><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col3" align="center">Mean gallium content of rabbit serum (ng/ml).</entry></row><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" rowsep="0"/><entry namest="col2" nameend="col3" align="center">Rabbits treated with</entry></row><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1"/><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="center">Composition A (3 animals)</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="center">Composition B (3 animals)</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="left">pro-treatment</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="right">0</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">0</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="char" char=".">1 hour</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="right">90</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">51</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="char" char=".">2 hours</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="right">274</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">99</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="char" char=".">4 hours</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="right">260</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">118</entry></row><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="char" char=".">8 hours</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="right">212</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">103</entry></row><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col1" align="char" char=".">24 hours</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col2" align="right">84</entry><entry namest="col3" nameend="col3" align="right">64</entry></row><row rowsep="1"><entry namest="col1" nameend="col3" align="justify">Composition A = Gallium ethyl maltol suspension<br/>Composition B = Gallium nitrate solution</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h0014">Example 3 -- <u>Preparation of gallium maltol</u></heading><p id="p0062" num="0062">Maltol is dissolved in chloroform to form a 0.75M solution, and gallium nitrate nonohydrate is dissolved in ethanol to form a 0.5M solution.
