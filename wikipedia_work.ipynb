      "text/plain": "Document(page_content='Experiments have been conducted on automated driving systems (ADS) since at least the 1920s;[21] trials began in the 1950s. The first semi-automated car was developed in 1977, by Japan\\'s Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory, which required specially marked streets that were interpreted by two cameras on the vehicle and an analog computer. The vehicle reached speeds up to 30 kilometres per hour (19\\xa0mph) with the support of an elevated rail.[22][23]\\nA landmark autonomous car appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University\\'s Navlab[24] and ALV[25][26] projects funded by the United States\\' Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) starting in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich\\'s EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987.[27] By 1985, the ALV had demonstrated self-driving speeds on two-lane roads of 31 kilometres per hour (19\\xa0mph), with obstacle avoidance added in 1986, and off-road driving in day and night time conditions by 1987.[28] A major milestone was achieved in 1995, with Carnegie Mellon University\\'s Navlab 5 completing the first autonomous coast-to-coast drive of the United States. Of the 2,849\\xa0mi (4,585\\xa0km) between Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and San Diego, California, 2,797\\xa0mi (4,501\\xa0km) were autonomous (98.2%), completed with an average speed of 63.8\\xa0mph (102.7\\xa0km/h).[29][30][31][32] From the 1960s through the second DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005, automated vehicle research in the United States was primarily funded by DARPA, the US Army, and the US Navy, yielding incremental advances in speeds, driving competence in more complex conditions, controls, and sensor systems.[33] Companies and research organizations have developed prototypes.[27][34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41]\\nThe US allocated US$650\\xa0million in 1991 for research on the National Automated Highway System, which demonstrated automated driving through a combination of automation embedded in the highway with automated technology in vehicles, and cooperative networking between the vehicles and with the highway infrastructure. The programme concluded with a successful demonstration in 1997 but without clear direction or funding to implement the system on a larger scale.[42] Partly funded by the National Automated Highway System and DARPA, the Carnegie Mellon University Navlab drove 4,584 kilometres (2,848\\xa0mi) across America in 1995, 4,501 kilometres (2,797\\xa0mi) or 98% of it autonomously.[43] Navlab\\'s record achievement stood unmatched for two decades until 2015, when Delphi improved it by piloting an Audi, augmented with Delphi technology, over 5,472 kilometres (3,400\\xa0mi) through 15 states while remaining in self-driving mode 99% of the time.[44] In 2015, the US states of Nevada, Florida, California, Virginia, and Michigan, together with Washington, DC, allowed the testing of automated cars on public roads.[45]\\nFrom 2016 to 2018, the European Commission funded an innovation strategy development for connected and automated driving through the Coordination Actions CARTRE and SCOUT.[46] Moreover, the Strategic Transport Research and Innovation Agenda (STRIA) Roadmap for Connected and Automated Transport was published in 2019.[47]\\nIn November 2017, Waymo announced that it had begun testing driverless cars without a safety driver in the driver position;[48] however, there was still an employee in the car.[49] An October 2017 report by the Brookings Institution found that $80\\xa0billion had been reported as invested in all facets of self driving technology up to that point, but that it was \"reasonable to presume that total global investment in autonomous vehicle technology is significantly more than this\".[50]\\nIn October 2018, Waymo announced that its test vehicles had traveled in automated mode for over 10,000,000 miles (16,000,000\\xa0km), increasing by about 1,000,000 miles (1,600,000 kilometres) per month.[51] In December 2018, Waymo was the first to commercialize a fully autonomous taxi service in the US, in Phoenix, Arizona.[52] In October 2020, Waymo launched a geo-fenced driverless ride hailing service in Phoenix.[53][54] The cars are being monitored in real-time by a team of remote engineers, and there are cases where the remote engineers need to intervene.[55][54]\\nIn March 2019, ahead of the autonomous racing series Roborace, Robocar set the Guinness World Record for being the fastest autonomous car in the world. In pushing the limits of self-driving vehicles, Robocar reached 282.42\\xa0km/h (175.49\\xa0mph) – an average confirmed by the UK Timing Association at Elvington in Yorkshire, UK.[56]\\nIn 2020, a National Transportation Safety Board chairman stated that no self-driving cars (SAE level 3+) were available for consumers to purchase in the US in 2020:\\nThere is not a vehicle currently available to US consumers that is self-driving. Period. Every vehicle sold to US consumers still requires the driver to be actively engaged in the driving task, even when advanced driver assistance systems are activated. If you are selling a car with an advanced driver assistance system, you\\'re not selling a self-driving car. If you are driving a car with an advanced driver assistance system, you don\\'t own a self-driving car.[57] On 5 March 2021, Honda began leasing in Japan a limited edition of 100 Legend Hybrid EX sedans equipped with the newly approved Level 3 automated driving equipment which had been granted the safety certification by Japanese government to their autonomous \"Traffic Jam Pilot\" driving technology, and legally allow drivers to take their eyes off the road.[14][15][58][16]', metadata={'Header 1': 'Self-driving car', 'Header 2': 'History'})"

      "text/plain": "\"query: A self-driving car, also known as an autonomous car, driverless car, or robotic car (robo-car),[1][2][3] is a car that is capable of traveling without human input.[4][5] Self-driving cars use sensors to perceive their surroundings, such as optical and thermographic cameras, radar, lidar, ultrasound/sonar, GPS, odometry and inertial measurement units.[6] Control systems interpret sensory information to create a three-dimensional model of the vehicle's surroundings. Based on the model, the car then identifies an appropriate navigation path and strategies for managing traffic controls (stop signs, traffic lights, speed limits, yield signs, etc.) and obstacles.[7][8][9][10][11]\\nOnce the technology matures, autonomous vehicles are predicted to impact the automotive industry, health, welfare, urban planning, traffic, insurance, labor market, and other fields. Their regulation is becoming an increasingly important issue.\\nAutonomy in vehicles is often divided into six levels,[12] according to a system developed by SAE International (SAE J3016).[13] The SAE levels can be roughly understood as Level 0 – no automation; Level 1 – hands on/shared control; Level 2 – hands off; Level 3 – eyes off; Level 4 – mind off, and Level 5 – steering wheel optional.\\nAs of April\\xa02023[update], vehicles operating at Level 3 and above are an insignificant market factor. In December 2020, Waymo became the first service provider to offer driverless taxi rides to the general public, in a part of Phoenix, Arizona. In March 2021, Honda was the first manufacturer to sell a legally approved Level 3 car.[14][15][16] Nuro began autonomous commercial delivery operations in California in 2021.[17] In December 2021, Mercedes-Benz received approval for a Level 3 car.[18] In February 2022, Cruise became the second service provider to offer driverless taxi rides to the general public, in San Francisco.[19]\\nIn December 2022, several manufacturers had scaled back plans for self-driving technology, including Ford and Volkswagen.[20]\""

      "text/plain": "Document(page_content='Experiments have been conducted on automated driving systems (ADS) since at least the 1920s;[22] trials began in the 1950s. The first semi-automated car was developed in 1977, by Japan\\'s Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory, which required specially marked streets that were interpreted by two cameras on the vehicle and an analog computer. The vehicle reached speeds up to 30 kilometres per hour (19\\xa0mph) with the support of an elevated rail.[23][24]\\nA landmark autonomous car appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University\\'s Navlab[25] and ALV[26][27] projects funded by the United States\\' Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) starting in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich\\'s EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987.[28] By 1985, the ALV had demonstrated self-driving speeds on two-lane roads of 31 kilometres per hour (19\\xa0mph), with obstacle avoidance added in 1986, and off-road driving in day and night time conditions by 1987.[29] A major milestone was achieved in 1995, with Carnegie Mellon University\\'s Navlab 5 completing the first autonomous coast-to-coast drive of the United States. Of the 2,849\\xa0mi (4,585\\xa0km) between Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and San Diego, California, 2,797\\xa0mi (4,501\\xa0km) were autonomous (98.2%), completed with an average speed of 63.8\\xa0mph (102.7\\xa0km/h).[30][31][32][33] From the 1960s through the second DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005, automated vehicle research in the United States was primarily funded by DARPA, the US Army, and the US Navy, yielding incremental advances in speeds, driving competence in more complex conditions, controls, and sensor systems.[34] Companies and research organizations have developed prototypes.[28][35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42]\\nThe US allocated US$650\\xa0million in 1991 for research on the National Automated Highway System, which demonstrated automated driving through a combination of automation embedded in the highway with automated technology in vehicles, and cooperative networking between the vehicles and with the highway infrastructure. The programme concluded with a successful demonstration in 1997 but without clear direction or funding to implement the system on a larger scale.[43] Partly funded by the National Automated Highway System and DARPA, the Carnegie Mellon University Navlab drove 4,584 kilometres (2,848\\xa0mi) across America in 1995, 4,501 kilometres (2,797\\xa0mi) or 98% of it autonomously.[44] Navlab\\'s record achievement stood unmatched for two decades until 2015, when Delphi improved it by piloting an Audi, augmented with Delphi technology, over 5,472 kilometres (3,400\\xa0mi) through 15 states while remaining in self-driving mode 99% of the time.[45] In 2015, the US states of Nevada, Florida, California, Virginia, and Michigan, together with Washington, DC, allowed the testing of automated cars on public roads.[46]\\nFrom 2016 to 2018, the European Commission funded an innovation strategy development for connected and automated driving through the Coordination Actions CARTRE and SCOUT.[47] Moreover, the Strategic Transport Research and Innovation Agenda (STRIA) Roadmap for Connected and Automated Transport was published in 2019.[48]\\nIn November 2017, Waymo announced that it had begun testing driverless cars without a safety driver in the driver position;[49] however, there was still an employee in the car.[50] An October 2017 report by the Brookings Institution found that $80\\xa0billion had been reported as invested in all facets of self driving technology up to that point, but that it was \"reasonable to presume that total global investment in autonomous vehicle technology is significantly more than this\".[51]\\nIn October 2018, Waymo announced that its test vehicles had traveled in automated mode for over 10,000,000 miles (16,000,000\\xa0km), increasing by about 1,000,000 miles (1,600,000 kilometres) per month.[52] In December 2018, Waymo was the first to commercialize a fully autonomous taxi service in the US, in Phoenix, Arizona.[53] In October 2020, Waymo launched a geo-fenced driverless ride hailing service in Phoenix.[54][55] The cars are being monitored in real-time by a team of remote engineers, and there are cases where the remote engineers need to intervene.[56][55]\\nIn March 2019, ahead of the autonomous racing series Roborace, Robocar set the Guinness World Record for being the fastest autonomous car in the world. In pushing the limits of self-driving vehicles, Robocar reached 282.42\\xa0km/h (175.49\\xa0mph) – an average confirmed by the UK Timing Association at Elvington in Yorkshire, UK.[57]\\nIn 2020, a National Transportation Safety Board chairman stated that no self-driving cars (SAE level 3+) were available for consumers to purchase in the US in 2020:\\nThere is not a vehicle currently available to US consumers that is self-driving. Period. Every vehicle sold to US consumers still requires the driver to be actively engaged in the driving task, even when advanced driver assistance systems are activated. If you are selling a car with an advanced driver assistance system, you\\'re not selling a self-driving car. If you are driving a car with an advanced driver assistance system, you don\\'t own a self-driving car.[58] On 5 March 2021, Honda began leasing in Japan a limited edition of 100 Legend Hybrid EX sedans equipped with the newly approved Level 3 automated driving equipment which had been granted the safety certification by Japanese government to their autonomous \"Traffic Jam Pilot\" driving technology, and legally allow drivers to take their eyes off the road.[14][15][59][16]', metadata={'Header 1': 'Self-driving car', 'Header 2': 'History'})"

DPE occurs in a wide range of physical, biological and social systems.

It occurs when a system repeatedly switches between various kinds of phases, and in each phase different processes act on the components or connections in the system. DPE arises because of a property of <a href=\"/wiki/Graph_theory\" title=\"Graph theory\">graphs</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Network_theory\" title=\"Network theory\">networks</a>: the connectivity avalanche that occurs in graphs as the number of edges increases.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Erdos1960_2-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Erdos1960-2\">[2]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Social networks provide a familiar example. In a <a href=\"/wiki/Social_network\" title=\"Social network\">social network</a> the nodes of the network are people and the network connections (edges) are relationships or interactions between people. For any individual, social activity alternates between a <i>local phase</i>, in which they interact only with people they already know, and a <i>global phase</i> in which they can interact with a wide pool of people not previously known to them. Historically, these phases have been forced on people by constraints of time and space. People spend most of their time in a local phase and interact only with those immediately around them (family, neighbors, colleagues). However, intermittent activities such as parties, holidays, and conferences involve a shift into a global phase where they can interact with different people they do not know. Different processes dominate each phase. Essentially, people make new social links when in the global phase, and refine or break them (by ceasing contact) while in the local phase.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_DPE_mechanism\">The DPE mechanism</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Dual-phase_evolution&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: The DPE mechanism\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The following features are necessary for DPE to occur.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-DPE2_1-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-DPE2-1\">[1]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Underlying_network\">Underlying network</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Dual-phase_evolution&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Underlying network\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>DPE occurs where a system has an underlying network. That is, the system's components form a set of nodes and there are connections (edges) that join them. For example, a family tree is a network in which the nodes are people (with names) and the edges are relationships such as \"mother of\" or \"married to\". The nodes in the network can take physical form, such as atoms held together by atomic forces, or they may be dynamic states or conditions, such as positions on a chess board with moves by the players defining the edges.\n</p><p>In mathematical terms (<a href=\"/wiki/Graph_theory\" title=\"Graph theory\">graph theory</a>), a graph <span class=\"mwe-math-element\"><span class=\"mwe-math-mathml-inline mwe-math-mathml-a11y\" style=\"display: none;\"><math alttext=\"{\\displaystyle \\textstyle G=\\langle N,E\\rangle }\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n<semantics>\n<mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\n<mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\">\n<mstyle displaystyle=\"false\" scriptlevel=\"0\">\n<mi>G</mi>\n<mo>=</mo>\n<mo fence=\"false\" stretchy=\"false\">⟨</mo>\n<mi>N</mi>\n<mo>,</mo>\n<mi>E</mi>\n<mo fence=\"false\" stretchy=\"false\">⟩</mo>\n</mstyle>\n</mstyle>\n</mrow>\n<annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">{\\displaystyle \\textstyle G=\\langle N,E\\rangle }</annotation>\n</semantics>\n</math></span><img alt=\"\\textstyle G=\\langle N,E\\rangle \" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"mwe-math-fallback-image-inline\" src=\"https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f5f7a9843d325596803885da82ff89768d47179f\" style=\"vertical-align: -0.838ex; width:11.608ex; height:2.843ex;\"/></span> is a set of nodes <span class=\"mwe-math-element\"><span class=\"mwe-math-mathml-inline mwe-math-mathml-a11y\" style=\"display: none;\"><math alttext=\"{\\displaystyle \\textstyle N}\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n<semantics>\n<mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\n<mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\">\n<mstyle displaystyle=\"false\" scriptlevel=\"0\">\n<mi>N</mi>\n</mstyle>\n</mstyle>\n</mrow>\n<annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">{\\displaystyle \\textstyle N}</annotation>\n</semantics>\n</math></span><img alt=\"\\textstyle N\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"mwe-math-fallback-image-inline\" src=\"https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a01b816d7d3e71a63798ca1ec640fac754da49dc\" style=\"vertical-align: -0.338ex; width:2.064ex; height:2.176ex;\"/></span> and a set of edges <span class=\"mwe-math-element\"><span class=\"mwe-math-mathml-inline mwe-math-mathml-a11y\" style=\"display: none;\"><math alttext=\"{\\displaystyle \\textstyle E\\subset \\{(x,y)\\mid x,y\\in N\\}}\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n<semantics>\n<mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\n<mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\">\n<mstyle displaystyle=\"false\" scriptlevel=\"0\">\n<mi>E</mi>\n<mo>⊂</mo>\n<mo fence=\"false\" stretchy=\"false\">{</mo>\n<mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo>\n<mi>x</mi>\n<mo>,</mo>\n<mi>y</mi>\n<mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo>\n<mo>∣</mo>\n<mi>x</mi>\n<mo>,</mo>\n<mi>y</mi>\n<mo>∈</mo>\n<mi>N</mi>\n<mo fence=\"false\" stretchy=\"false\">}</mo>\n</mstyle>\n</mstyle>\n</mrow>\n<annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">{\\displaystyle \\textstyle E\\subset \\{(x,y)\\mid x,y\\in N\\}}</annotation>\n</semantics>\n</math></span><img alt=\"\\textstyle E \\subset \\{ (x,y) \\mid x,y \\in N \\}\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"mwe-math-fallback-image-inline\" src=\"https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/52f527fd6ae435702bd3293c988ed158cced0346\" style=\"vertical-align: -0.838ex; width:22.888ex; height:2.843ex;\"/></span>.

In effect, a graph has two phases: connected (most nodes are linked by pathways of interaction) and fragmented (nodes are either isolated or form small subgraphs). These are often referred to as <b>global</b> and <b>local</b> phases, respectively.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:214px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/wiki/File:Figure1a.gif\"><img class=\"thumbimage\" data-file-height=\"146\" data-file-width=\"212\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"146\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Figure1a.gif\" width=\"212\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/wiki/File:Figure1a.gif\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Fragmented graph.</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:215px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/wiki/File:Figure1b.gif\"><img class=\"thumbimage\" data-file-height=\"146\" data-file-width=\"213\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"146\" src=\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Figure1b.gif\" width=\"213\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/wiki/File:Figure1b.gif\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Connected graph.</div></div></div>\n<p>An essential feature of DPE is that the system undergoes repeated shifts between the two phases.

Most commonly the two processes at work can be interpreted as <i>variation</i> and <i>selection</i>. <i>Variation</i> refers to new features, which typically appear in one of the two phases. These features may be new nodes, new edges, or new properties of the nodes or edges. <i>Selection</i> here refers to ways in which the features are modified, refined, selected or removed.

This means that the processes acting in each phase can modify or refine patterns formed in the other phase. For instance, in a social network, if a person makes new acquaintances during a global phase, then some of these new social connections might survive into the local phase to become long-term friends. In this way, DPE can create effects that may be impossible if both processes act at the same time.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Examples\">Examples</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Dual-phase_evolution&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Examples\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>DPE has been found to occur in many natural and artificial systems.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Paperin2011_3-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Paperin2011-3\">[3]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Social_networks\">Social networks</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Dual-phase_evolution&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Social networks\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>DPE is capable of producing social networks with known topologies, notably <a href=\"/wiki/Small-world_network\" title=\"Small-world network\">small-world networks</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Scale-free_network\" title=\"Scale-free network\">scale-free networks</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Paperin2011_3-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Paperin2011-3\">[3]</a></sup>\n<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Small_world_network\" title=\"Small world network\">Small world networks</a>, which are common in traditional societies, are a natural consequence of alternating <i>local</i> and <i>global</i> phases: new, long-distance links are formed during the global phase and existing links are reinforced (or removed) during the local phase.
